How Much, and Why?","PresentationRootId":"5a2eb7d3-8f7a-4ff4-be12-2f77fd3e240a","Description":"You may have already heard about the vSphere APIs for IO Filtering (VAIO) in vSphere 6, and how they allow you to use third party caching data services to achieve lower latency storage IO. But just how much lower latency does the new API framework enable versus previous cache designs? As the developer of a PVSP-certified solid-state cache integrated with vSphere 5 through the Pluggable Storage Architecture (PSA), as well as VMware design partner for the caching APIs in the VAIO framework, we\u0026rsquo;ve investigated this issue thoroughly. Using a variety of workloads and IO profiles, we\u0026rsquo;ve benchmarked the responsiveness of cache performance in both designs to measure how much a solid-state host cache can reduce IO latency through VAIO versus the PSA and VMFS stack. In this session, you can see the data from a variety of our comparison tests. In addition, you can learn about other new design features and capabilities in VAIO, such as virtual disk-level acceleration, that deliver additional performance benefits for specific types of workloads. Demonstrations of the test methodologies and results will be provided.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 13:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 14:08:08","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"38 Minutes 8 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/5a2eb7d38f7a4ff4be122f77fd3e240a1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/5a2eb7d38f7a4ff4be122f77fd3e240a1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/5a2eb7d38f7a4ff4be122f77fd3e240a1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5a2eb7d38f7a4ff4be122f77fd3e240a1d/41554ab5-7bcc-403e-a9e5-34e88b9adbfb_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5a2eb7d38f7a4ff4be122f77fd3e240a1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"e5ac8d45-af12-4808-9e66-6b257f151dc5","Presenters":[{"Id":"9831600b4ba74899bc9ef451c757b2ca2a","Name":"Manish Apte, Western Digital Corp","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Manish Apte, Western Digital Corp","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-293707852,"ParentResource":"5a2eb7d3-8f7a-4ff4-be12-2f77fd3e240a"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":15},{"Id":"90c462b2fea842c783c3aa28ae0646151d","Name":"STO7973 - Architecting Site Recovery Manager to Meet Your Recovery Goals","PresentationRootId":"90c462b2-fea8-42c7-83c3-aa28ae064615","Description":"VMware customers have a variety of options available when deciding how to architect their Site Recovery Manager deployment.

We\u0027ll review Baystate Health\u0027s design, key configurations, and lessons they learned from running production workloads on vSphere 6, Virtual SAN (VSAN), and NSX across three data centers in this active-active-active design. This design enables zero-downtime application mobility across data centers, as well as automated HA failover in the event a host or an entire site is lost. VMware NSX provides key capabilities for ensuring IP mobility across the three data centers and builds security into the virtual infrastructure with distributed firewall and micro-segmentation capabilities.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 16:27:30","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"57 Minutes 30 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/b0553326bee6422787d6637a1e444da61d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/b0553326bee6422787d6637a1e444da61d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/b0553326bee6422787d6637a1e444da61d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b0553326bee6422787d6637a1e444da61d/34f53d39-c4e0-4a0e-8c16-1495ce3572df_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b0553326bee6422787d6637a1e444da61d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"e5ac8d45-af12-4808-9e66-6b257f151dc5","Presenters":[{"Id":"42d8fd06a9eb49fc92d64058662300072a","Name":"Scott Carpenter, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Scott Carpenter, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":946364156,"ParentResource":"b0553326-bee6-4227-87d6-637a1e444da6"},{"Id":"52a1c84c788d4f44b91b59c1a699178c2a","Name":"Justin Bias, Baystate Health","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Justin Bias, Baystate Health","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":172254817,"ParentResource":"b0553326-bee6-4227-87d6-637a1e444da6"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":17},{"Id":"ffc1f715dfcb480fb19410262fd61cfe1d","Name":"STO8880 - Successful ROBO Design with vSphere \u0026 Virtual SAN","PresentationRootId":"ffc1f715-dfcb-480f-b194-10262fd61cfe","Description":"VMware Virtual SAN is radically simple storage for vSphere that is taking the IT world by storm.

Intel and VMware present the results of running Hadoop workloads on a standard all-flash VSAN cluster. In the past, virtualized Hadoop workloads have been demonstrated on ESX clusters with Big Data Extensions (BDE). We take virtualized Hadoop to the next level by running it on VMware VSAN clusters. Running Hadoop over VSAN immediately provides Hadoop with all the advantages VSAN 6.2 brings to the table like Replication, Fault Tolerance, Compression, Erasure Code, Data De-Duplication, all while being highly integrated into the ESXi Hypervisor. All-Flash VSAN provides robust performance for Hadoop workloads, and reduces the TCO for customers by virtualizing many hundreds of Hadoop servers running as VMs on a much lower number of physical servers. VMware and Intel embarked on a joint project to showcase Hadoop workloads on VSAN based on high customer demand for running big data analytics on VSAN nodes. We will be presenting the benefits and results of running Hadoop on VSAN including CapEx, and OpEx benefits, and performance results of running the TPC-x-HS benchmarks. We will be sharing performance comparisons of running Bare-metal Hadoop vs Virtualized Hadoop with BDE vs Hyperconverged Hadoop over VSAN. The testing, and benchmarking will be done on an 8 node followed by 32 node VSAN cluster highlighting the capabilities of linear storage scale out architecture and performance. All VSAN nodes are powered by Intel Xeon Processor Based Servers, Intel NVMe SSDs, Intel SATA SSDs, and Intel Network Adapters along with VMware VSAN 6.2.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 14:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 15:12:49","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"42 Minutes 49 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/8fa468f6f9e7493a909dde86077ab5681d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/8fa468f6f9e7493a909dde86077ab5681d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/8fa468f6f9e7493a909dde86077ab5681d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8fa468f6f9e7493a909dde86077ab5681d/5328b04c-66d8-4b03-8b6f-aefbc30ce27d_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8fa468f6f9e7493a909dde86077ab5681d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"e5ac8d45-af12-4808-9e66-6b257f151dc5","Presenters":[{"Id":"52d70cabd77a4d2fb9d1c7a4a00d17f22a","Name":"Vahid Fereydounkolahi, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Vahid Fereydounkolahi, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1054677128,"ParentResource":"8fa468f6-f9e7-493a-909d-de86077ab568"},{"Id":"72eee664c0f245bfbfb24e9da532a9fc2a","Name":"Anjaneya Chagam, INTEL CORPORATION","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Anjaneya Chagam, INTEL CORPORATION","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":38784476,"ParentResource":"8fa468f6-f9e7-493a-909d-de86077ab568"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":13},{"Id":"1b081f79482c4bdca2cb5cb64a5f159e1d","Name":"STO8750 - Troubleshooting Virtual SAN 6.2: Tips \u0026 Tricks for the Real World","PresentationRootId":"1b081f79-482c-4bdc-a2cb-5cb64a5f159e","Description":"VMware Virtual SAN 6.2 is the fourth generation of VMware\u0027s radically simple, enterprise-class software-defined storage that powers leading Hyper-Converged Infrastructure solutions.

Baystate Health, a leading Healthcare organization, has leveraged VMware\u0027s Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) to meet ever increasing demands for high availability and security while facing IT budget cuts. We\u0027ll review Baystate Health\u0027s design, key configurations, and lessons they learned from running production workloads on vSphere 6, Virtual SAN (VSAN), and NSX across three data centers in this active-active-active design. This design enables zero-downtime application mobility across data centers, as well as automated HA failover in the event a host or an entire site is lost. VMware NSX provides key capabilities for ensuring IP mobility across the three data centers and builds security into the virtual infrastructure with distributed firewall and micro-segmentation capabilities.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 13:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 13:59:16","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"59 Minutes 16 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/a46df02109fd4498aa908078a2c017941d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/a46df02109fd4498aa908078a2c017941d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/a46df02109fd4498aa908078a2c017941d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a46df02109fd4498aa908078a2c017941d/c13e73b8-a035-4a0c-8dde-8c7f308774da_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a46df02109fd4498aa908078a2c017941d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"e5ac8d45-af12-4808-9e66-6b257f151dc5","Presenters":[{"Id":"de10c2445ef8433aab2a0d853963f67f2a","Name":"Scott Carpenter, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Scott Carpenter, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":946364156,"ParentResource":"a46df021-09fd-4498-aa90-8078a2c01794"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":9},{"Id":"7e6184714b11496a860b372cf6b82d381d","Name":"STO7791-SPO - Insights to success: Capitalizing on the software-defined data center with the right management and storage","PresentationRootId":"7e618471-4b11-496a-860b-372cf6b82d38","Description":"What role does software-defined storage (SDS) have in the software-defined data center (SDDC)? What advantages does SDS have over traditional storage? Join a panel of early adopter experts who will share their experiences and tips for successfully building a solid storage foundation for their hybrid cloud and SDDC using the latest offerings from VMware and IBM. Trailblazing companies such as Time Warner Cable and Cobalt Iron will reveal key success factors for achieving business and information technology (IT) outcomes.

Key to building a robust SDDC, the ability to deploy applications in this hybrid cloud environment in a simple, agile, and secure manner will also be presented. Automating storage management and data protection are by no means simple tasks. Panelists will disclose how they have accomplished automation and other cloud goals using the VMware vRealize Suite and VMware vCloud Director. They will also discuss how they have overcome challenges to achieve the requisite levels of performance, scalability, and security for all forms of data. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how virtualization and automation can help you transform from a traditional shop to an IT-as-a-Service model, thereby achieving the ultimate business goals of becoming more agile and competitive.

This session will focus specifically on the availability features of VMware Virtual SAN. It is a technical discussion that begins with a quick explanation of how Virtual SAN stores virtual machine objects such as configuration (VMX) files and virtual disk (VMDK) files. Next, we will take a look at storage policy-based management (SPBM) as this is the primary method for configuring and managing the levels of resiliency for virtual machine objects. We will examine the differences between and requirements for RAID-1 mirroring and RAID-5/6 erasure coding rules in Virtual SAN storage policies and how these rules affect the number and placement of objects. Next, we will provide technical details around Virtual SAN fault domains and stretched clusters. The session will finish with some notes on Virtual SAN data protection using VMware vSphere Replication and VMware vSphere Data Protection while leaving sufficient time for Q\u0026A with the speakers.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"4:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 16:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 16:59:48","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"59 Minutes 48 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/301a49bc4e044782bbdd5089ab6d2cab1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/301a49bc4e044782bbdd5089ab6d2cab1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/301a49bc4e044782bbdd5089ab6d2cab1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/301a49bc4e044782bbdd5089ab6d2cab1d/b71d1b3b-3eba-4ec1-b674-220161a1af6b_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/301a49bc4e044782bbdd5089ab6d2cab1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"e5ac8d45-af12-4808-9e66-6b257f151dc5","Presenters":[{"Id":"1ceeacb0cba647a0bd02af3d96cd5aed2a","Name":"Jeff Hunter, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jeff Hunter, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":52521139,"ParentResource":"301a49bc-4e04-4782-bbdd-5089ab6d2cab"},{"Id":"c0b0850158c840c5a0e9e4567f2597502a","Name":"Gurusimran Khalsa, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Gurusimran Khalsa, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-599957984,"ParentResource":"301a49bc-4e04-4782-bbdd-5089ab6d2cab"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"," Technical – Advanced"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":9},{"Id":"1e7003019096464b92f34115231262f41d","Name":"STO7802 - Simplifying Disaster Recovery in 2016 using VSAN, NSX and SRM","PresentationRootId":"1e700301-9096-464b-92f3-4115231262f4","Description":"Datacenter disaster recovery has always been complex with too many moving parts from to many separate vendors.

VVols eliminate static storage constraints by removing LUNs, filesystems, and volumes, and giving the array direct visibility and understanding of the VM objects they store. This enables a flexible policy based approach to storing and managing VMs without traditional concerns about capability and capacity management bounded by LUNs on the physical infrastructure. In this session we will look at the VVol framework VMware has created, and how NetApp is using this to deliver a new generation of VM-aware storage that places the VMs in charge. SAN and NAS devices are pooled into storage containers that deliver every capability of the array (such as compression, encryption, QoS, and more) to each VM as an individual and discrete object, fully integrating with VMware Storage Policy Based Management interface. We will look at the policy based consumption model as well as the specific technical components of VVols that enable this functionality: Protocol Endpoints, VASA Providers, Storage Containers, virtual datastores, and more. Learn about this revolutionary change in the way storage is delivered to VMware environments, and how this industry-wide initiative will allow you an efficient and intelligent new way to use NetApp arrays.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 16:27:53","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"57 Minutes 53 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/e992402f2e9e4de58e21bdefa6060cfe1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/e992402f2e9e4de58e21bdefa6060cfe1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/e992402f2e9e4de58e21bdefa6060cfe1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e992402f2e9e4de58e21bdefa6060cfe1d/2f178066-e21e-4b17-9b93-a371278affdc_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e992402f2e9e4de58e21bdefa6060cfe1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"e5ac8d45-af12-4808-9e66-6b257f151dc5","Presenters":[{"Id":"210c527e4ea046acbd78eea26eb518e52a","Name":"Rhett Bigler, NetApp","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Rhett Bigler, NetApp","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1960259781,"ParentResource":"e992402f-2e9e-4de5-8e21-bdefa6060cfe"},{"Id":"cd4fd96e505349bfa08d8d18374cb1262a","Name":"Pete Flecha, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Pete Flecha, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-743159180,"ParentResource":"e992402f-2e9e-4de5-8e21-bdefa6060cfe"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":12},{"Id":"efe487061cb64101ae2d96eb5ca471de1d","Name":"STO8689 - Virtual SAN Primer and What?s New","PresentationRootId":"efe48706-1cb6-4101-ae2d-96eb5ca471de","Description":"Have you heard the buzz around HCI and Virtual SAN but have not had the time to catch up completely?

Flash is clearly gaining more and more prominence in enterprise storage. The evolution of high speed flash-based storage combined with high speed networks has had a significant impact on the Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) market. In this session, we will discuss how we leverage newer hardware technologies to enable the fastest and most efficient hyper converged infrastructure solution with All Flash Virtual SAN. We will start with key design considerations for achieving the best performance with All Flash HCI. In doing so, we will go over real world customer use cases, key sizing guidelines and share performance metrics for high performance computing workloads driven by NVMe for Virtual SAN All Flash. We will then move on to analyzing benefits of adopting Non Volatile DIMMs and RDMA for Virtual SAN. Historically, the All Flash market was driven by \u0026ldquo;purpose-built\u0026rdquo; appliances with custom hardware to enable faster caching and reduce overall disk+network latencies. It wasnot considered feasible to do this in standard x86 servers connected on standard ethernet networks. Until recently, that is. Newer standards and technologies such as NVMe 1.2, Persistent DIMMs and RDMA over converged ethernet are expected to become standard in the OEM server market and will be driven by commoditization. We will go over benefits of adopting these high speed storage and network interconnects in the future for Virtual SAN. As cliched as this may sound, you are already part of this highly disruptive market. So what are you waiting for? Come and join us if you want to learn how VMware plans to lead market disruption with its turbocharged All Flash Virtual SAN offering by taking advantage of newer hardware technologies for HCI.

Direct-attached low latency and ultra-low latency non-volatile storage technologies facilitate massive increases in performance and scale. These technologies, when combined with VMware Virtual SAN and the power of vSphere profile driven storage, enable the transition from traditional applications, which require robust infrastructure services, to next generation applications with scaling and protection built in. Today, it clear to VMware and the IT industry that All-flash is the preferred configuration over hybrid Virtual SAN, but what next? Do you need to have the latest NVMe architecture, or will SATA or SAS suffice? What technologies come after flash SSDs, and how will that affect your storage? Micron has been on the forefront of pushing VMware Virtual SAN capabilities.

The failure domains were based on the 2 sources of power inside a ship, a hard constraint based on the ships\u0027 design. The previous (non-VMware) architecture included several limitations; most notably requiring manual administrative intervention to recover from outages and requiring a level of technical skill and understanding not present in the shipboard personnel performing these tasks. These limitations have resulted several times in having to provide onsite engineering support to perform recovery and troubleshooting, and have exposed a very real potential for permanent data loss due to lack of system understanding and inability to troubleshoot the complex environment by local resources, along with procedural issues. The other key challenges were to reduce the Space, Weight, and Power (SWaP) that the infrastructure consumes, as these resources come at a premium on a US Navy ship, and to significantly reduce system complexity for ease of administration. By eliminating the multiple legacy SANs previously required, these challenges were easily achievable and far exceeded expectations. VMware\u0027s Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC) capabilities brought together one fully supported solution which made IT resiliency easy, reduced downtime, reduced the amount of servers required, eliminated legacy SANs, and ultimately reduced the customer\u0027s total cost of ownership (TCO).","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 16:22:12","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"52 Minutes 12 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/38a2e3f59c60406f961cc2f1c1225f681d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/38a2e3f59c60406f961cc2f1c1225f681d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/38a2e3f59c60406f961cc2f1c1225f681d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/38a2e3f59c60406f961cc2f1c1225f681d/b1a11681-763e-4862-b694-7af60419d797_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/38a2e3f59c60406f961cc2f1c1225f681d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"e5ac8d45-af12-4808-9e66-6b257f151dc5","Presenters":[{"Id":"70fac35de5684cd9879b1bec5beb58b62a","Name":"Zachary Widing, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Zachary Widing, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":999592944,"ParentResource":"38a2e3f5-9c60-406f-961c-c2f1c1225f68"},{"Id":"8cc12d77fb5d4c99aa358470f29cd9bd2a","Name":"Michael Grossman, Government Secure Solutions CGI, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Michael Grossman, Government Secure Solutions CGI, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1562099326,"ParentResource":"38a2e3f5-9c60-406f-961c-c2f1c1225f68"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":9},{"Id":"7abb9a4d5a004e378ddde985765948001d","Name":"STO8743 - Extreme Performance Series: Virtual SAN Performance Troubeshooting","PresentationRootId":"7abb9a4d-5a00-4e37-8ddd-e98576594800","Description":"Troubleshooting performance issues in a distributed storage solution such as Virtual SAN is complicated due to the interconnectedness of storage, networking and compute.
