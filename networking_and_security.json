With single point of integration between physical and virtual elements, deep network and application visibility, an open ecosystem model, and fully automated infrastructure, customers can drive down cost and complexity while driving up operational efficiency.\nMany IT organizations have started the migration from existing legacy architectures to these new Software Defined Data Center architectures. There is a wealth of knowledge gained from their experiences that can be shared with others organizations who are considering similar migrations in their own future.\nThis session will highlight the data center environment at American Tire Distributor (ATD), Inc., as a real-world customer case study and example of this type of migration. ATD engineering lead will share his experience in migrating from their legacy data center architecture toward a modern physical + virtual architecture leveraging Arista EOS and VMware NSX integrated software defined data center solution. ATD will be joined by Arista and VMware in this joint presentation covering key migration steps and lessons learned in migrating both the physical underlay and the virtual overlay.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 13:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 14:22:46","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"52 Minutes 46 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/84b600f69ae14d15823e30c0ca96358e1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/84b600f69ae14d15823e30c0ca96358e1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/84b600f69ae14d15823e30c0ca96358e1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/84b600f69ae14d15823e30c0ca96358e1d/8cb40bd9-0ea9-46e6-ae3e-04aa1b4e5507_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/84b600f69ae14d15823e30c0ca96358e1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"c2d892a310b34414bd44364704f69a0e2a","Name":"Jeff Raymond, Arista Networks","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jeff Raymond, Arista Networks","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":211635551,"ParentResource":"84b600f6-9ae1-4d15-823e-30c0ca96358e"},{"Id":"e8e65ce7ddc24e2d8afb8577a2a0add62a","Name":"Brandon Smith, American Tire Distributors","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Brandon Smith, American Tire Distributors","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1980244160,"ParentResource":"84b600f6-9ae1-4d15-823e-30c0ca96358e"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":33},{"Id":"e8b7d470cbdc40c084e4560997540f431d","Name":"NET9069 - Automating Traffic Visibility for the Software-Defined Data Center","PresentationRootId":"e8b7d470-cbdc-40c0-84e4-560997540f43","Description":"With more than 80% of the workloads in the data center expected to be virtual in 2016, and 80% of this traffic being east-west, a primary challenge for centralized monitoring infrastructure is to access this virtual traffic for application, network, and security analysis. In addition, next-generation private clouds powered by VMware NSX are being designed from the ground up for scale and agility, and VM-to-Host consolidation ratios are touching 50:1 to 100:1. Thus, the SecOps and NetOps teams that are charted to secure, record, and analyze this traffic are demanding automated and continuous visibility of these virtual workloads. This session describes how the ITOps teams can automate traffic visibility for the SDDC, leveraging VMware NSX Dynamic Service Insertion and Gigamon Security Delivery Platform (SDP), while preserving the security and monitoring investments. A use case for a large federal civilian agency automating their traffic visibility will also be discussed to illustrate the technical details and business benefits.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 13:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 14:16:44","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"46 Minutes 44 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/e8b7d470cbdc40c084e4560997540f431d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/e8b7d470cbdc40c084e4560997540f431d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/e8b7d470cbdc40c084e4560997540f431d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e8b7d470cbdc40c084e4560997540f431d/3c3c8b23-da9e-4ce7-8f58-caaca7fafb85_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e8b7d470cbdc40c084e4560997540f431d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"153e001024c440efa65a810a5f2ff27f2a","Name":"Sesh Sayani, Gigamon","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Sesh Sayani, Gigamon","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-2033548356,"ParentResource":"e8b7d470-cbdc-40c0-84e4-560997540f43"},{"Id":"eece9588157d451aa2b83404bd8af1472a","Name":"Vyenkatesh Deshpande, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Vyenkatesh Deshpande, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":420031068,"ParentResource":"e8b7d470-cbdc-40c0-84e4-560997540f43"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":14},{"Id":"fff4ffcd1d164d198e8de224006a054d1d","Name":"SEC8081 - Healthcare: The Security Awakens","PresentationRootId":"fff4ffcd-1d16-4d19-8e8d-e224006a054d","Description":"A 2015 Experian study stated that data breaches cost the healthcare industry $5.6 billion every year. Healthcare security is a design principle, not a product, so healthcare IT must build security into every system to provide a better and more secure experience. Minimizing security breaches avoids money being spent on fines and fixing problems, allowing it to be directed back into new and innovative IT projects and improved patient care and provider satisfaction. Healthcare IT security involves lifecycle management of applications. From inception to the end of individual applications\u0027 functional life, every aspect must be standardized, secured, and monitored. This session will challenge you to take a new look at your healthcare systems and how you are designing and deploying systems and applications. Improving your security posture\u0026mdash;not through products but through principles\u0026mdash;enables your providers to focus on patient care, not public relations.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 13:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 14:18:47","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"48 Minutes 47 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/fff4ffcd1d164d198e8de224006a054d1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/fff4ffcd1d164d198e8de224006a054d1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/fff4ffcd1d164d198e8de224006a054d1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/fff4ffcd1d164d198e8de224006a054d1d/12d7451d-4ee5-4402-b390-a07cce4c5086_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/fff4ffcd1d164d198e8de224006a054d1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"fc678341f6514898af674f17779714692a","Name":"Aaron Dumbrow, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Aaron Dumbrow, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-124863567,"ParentResource":"fff4ffcd-1d16-4d19-8e8d-e224006a054d"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":10},{"Id":"cd97722f61f24f8da33718ab103bd1431d","Name":"SEC8667 - Deep Dive into Real-Life Data-Center Breaches and How They Could Have Been Avoided","PresentationRootId":"cd97722f-61f2-4f8d-a337-18ab103bd143","Description":"Changing with the times is frequently overlooked when it comes to data center security. Technology is becoming increasingly dynamic, but most data centers still use archaic security measures to protect their network, which doesn\u0027t provide sufficient protection against today\u0027s sophisticated attacks. Data centers house a huge amount of sensitive data, and thus there shouldn\u0027t be any shortcomings when implementing security to protect these environments. The focus has traditionally been on adding protection only at the perimeter to keep threats outside, but implementing perimeter-centric security leaves the inside of the data center vulnerable. Cybercriminals are constantly using advanced techniques to target assets inside the data center. Once inside, they are able to freely propagate their malware against other internal assets. Without upgrading data center security protections with advanced multilayered threat prevention and zero-day protections, hackers gain visibility and access to steal data and disrupt business processes before they are even detected. Join our session where will share more about recent data center breaches -- where lateral movement and sophisticated techniques were used -- and detail how organizations can prevent the next attack by using mirco-segmentation along with advanced multilayered threat prevention in the software-defined data center.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 12:00:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 12:53:27","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"53 Minutes 27 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/cd97722f61f24f8da33718ab103bd1431d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/cd97722f61f24f8da33718ab103bd1431d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/cd97722f61f24f8da33718ab103bd1431d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/cd97722f61f24f8da33718ab103bd1431d/220bb9d5-c83f-4822-afb3-82796d29b1b3_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/cd97722f61f24f8da33718ab103bd1431d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"c54ff2fd0da242e3a7f39360ecd550902a","Name":"Jeremiah Cornelius, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jeremiah Cornelius, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1035797389,"ParentResource":"cd97722f-61f2-4f8d-a337-18ab103bd143"},{"Id":"ddd283df297e4e04b9073aa66abd83862a","Name":"Yoav Shay Daniely, Check Point","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Yoav Shay Daniely, Check Point","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-571014601,"ParentResource":"cd97722f-61f2-4f8d-a337-18ab103bd143"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":23},{"Id":"75a61b45b24d483f90ec98786d2c1b971d","Name":"NET8832 - The Role of VIO and NSX in Virtualizing the Telecoms Infrastructure","PresentationRootId":"75a61b45-b24d-483f-90ec-98786d2c1b97","Description":"What can we take from enterprise IT and cloud services experiences to help communication service providers accelerate their Network Function Virtualization (NFV) projects?

Like many organizations, FIS found that the information asymmetry between infrastructure and security operations teams often made it difficult to identify and remediate possible threats persisting and propagating throughout the data center. The lag time between the identification of an infrastructure problem and when it was ultimately correlated to a root cause security incident was costly in terms of the impact to an organization. Hear the case study of how the University of Pittsburgh FIS team began utilizing VMware vRealize in order to centrally manage their on-premise virtualized environments and their public cloud deployments. Find out how they were able to enhance visibility of their modern data center system performance and the security controls they used to protect it \u0026ndash; correlating operational and security incidents across their data center in a single view. Attendees will hear the lessons that the University FIS group learned in the process of implementing this solution and how this ability to quickly identify and assess potential threats and manage and deploy security efficiently has increased their effectiveness in mitigating incidents with minimal impact to the organization.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 14:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 14:41:55","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"41 Minutes 55 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/9c2e54fd65ca45aeb9b917635a65e72d1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/9c2e54fd65ca45aeb9b917635a65e72d1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/9c2e54fd65ca45aeb9b917635a65e72d1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/9c2e54fd65ca45aeb9b917635a65e72d1d/33952086-9cac-4f9e-ae31-1b2364374c40_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/9c2e54fd65ca45aeb9b917635a65e72d1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"7ffc8bde26f84e42a4c98ea078441e372a","Name":"Richard Abbott, Trend Micro Canada Technologies Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Richard Abbott, Trend Micro Canada Technologies Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1009512739,"ParentResource":"9c2e54fd-65ca-45ae-b9b9-17635a65e72d"},{"Id":"c62ca9e147714f80a2b13d599256665f2a","Name":"Stephen Koch, University of Pittsburgh","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Stephen Koch, University of Pittsburgh","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-306291588,"ParentResource":"9c2e54fd-65ca-45ae-b9b9-17635a65e72d"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":3},{"Id":"6cebb88f9819434191f3d06369b604331d","Name":"NET8109 - Amadeus\u0027s Journey Building a Software-Defined Data Center with VMware Integrated OpenStack and NSX","PresentationRootId":"6cebb88f-9819-4341-91f3-d06369b60433","Description":"Amadeus IT Group, a multinational IT provider for global travel and tourism with over \u0026euro;3 billion in revenue, undertook a transformational project to modernize its infrastructure.

A vision for Software-Defined Security is introduced, and a three-part framework will outline how network security is evolving across all layers of the network architecture, from the data plane to the control plane to the management plane. A tightly integrated approach to orchestrating intrusion prevention, next-generation firewall and advanced Layer-7 security with VMware vSphere and NSX is demonstrated, along with a deep dive on actual customer use cases.

The technology has found a wide range of applications across use cases that range from automation to microsegmentation to data center pooling and disaster recovery. So what\u0027s next for network virtualization? This technical deep dive will take an \u0026quot;under the hood\u0026quot; look at network virtualization, examining the underlying architecture and its ongoing evolution. We will look at how the system is becoming more scalable through the use of clustering and the division of labor between the management, control, and data planes. The Data Plane Development Kit and flow caching are being used to boost data plane performance. We will discuss the evolution of the logical routing architecture, which will allow more complex routing topologies. Throughout the presentation, we\u0027ll tie the technical material to the expanding set of use cases that network virtualization is addressing and show how we will deliver networking and security services to any workload, anywhere\u0026mdash;across hypervisors, across multiple clouds, and to a wide range of endpoints.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 17:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 17:53:16","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"53 Minutes 16 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/3a6eff04923a46da86304913fbd64d2b1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/3a6eff04923a46da86304913fbd64d2b1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/3a6eff04923a46da86304913fbd64d2b1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/3a6eff04923a46da86304913fbd64d2b1d/9dc0f33c-aea8-4d82-bc71-5a7bbed9078c_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/3a6eff04923a46da86304913fbd64d2b1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"aa2f7dd3c2e14f50b22145efc15fd5ce2a","Name":"Bruce Davie, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Bruce Davie, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":763126016,"ParentResource":"3a6eff04-923a-46da-8630-4913fbd64d2b"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":36},{"Id":"ecc01c34d8ae4403b50d81912167980b1d","Name":"NET8039 - Bridging Virtual and Physical in NSX with Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol-Based Hardware VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint Integration","PresentationRootId":"ecc01c34-d8ae-4403-b50d-81912167980b","Description":"VMware NSX allows the integration of partner switching platforms for performing the bridge between virtual and physical networks (extending VXLAN-backed logical switches in NSX to VLANs in the nonvirtualized world).

For instance, the NSX Reference Guide recommends having three clusters: management, compute, and edge. But what if you have a flat or single-cluster design in place already? Or your data center footprint is very small and you do not have enough compute resources for separate cluster? Or your hyper-converged system vendor has restrictions? Does this mean you cannot deploy NSX? The answer is, no, not at all. So how do you design and deploy NSX in such a scenario?

The next session covers compute and edge cluster design best practices with VXLAN Layer 2 tunnel endpoints (VTEPs) and Virtual Disk Service. The last part covers edge cluster components and distributed routing.

In this session we will discuss the path customers are taking to adopt NSX and network virtualization. This session will cover the key use cases customers are embracing today. We will answer a number of questions, including where to start with NSX and how, and how partner integrations can help our customers. We will discuss outcomes customers can realize with NSX and how the new NSX features can help. Day 2 operations are critical when adopting any new technology, and we will use demos to show how NSX can easily integrate into an existing infrastructure. Whether in a greenfield or a brownfield use case, NSX can quickly be integrated into the environment and bring the benefits of the Software-Defined Data Center.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 14:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 15:28:34","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"58 Minutes 34 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/943fd3ba12374103afee5ceec11aca8b1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/943fd3ba12374103afee5ceec11aca8b1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/943fd3ba12374103afee5ceec11aca8b1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/943fd3ba12374103afee5ceec11aca8b1d/0fc03ad5-cddc-422e-9009-f477c676284f_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/943fd3ba12374103afee5ceec11aca8b1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"0f112a4b8899427ead26a262ac39838f2a","Name":"Matt Berry, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Matt Berry, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1376398533,"ParentResource":"943fd3ba-1237-4103-afee-5ceec11aca8b"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Introductory"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":13},{"Id":"230ed7e1b946466f93f0dc8fbcd2eca61d","Name":"SEC9609-SPO - Trusted Security in the Software Defined Data Center: Real-World Use Cases Across VMware Platforms, including NSX","PresentationRootId":"230ed7e1-b946-466f-93f0-dc8fbcd2eca6","Description":"We know by now that the Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) automates provisioning and massively reduces time-to-market for applications and services. However, many organizations are still relying on legacy physical server security to protect their SDDC. When securing your hybrid cloud environments it is imperative that you incorporate a layered security architecture that includes anti-malware, IDS/IPS, firewall, integrity monitoring and log inspection to maximize protection against the next big attack. In this session, industry analyst Jon Oltsik of the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) will host a discussionof Trend Micro customersaround proven security practices with a cross-section of industry leaders from organizations such as the University of Pittsburgh and Integra Networks.The panelists will provide insight into the value of a SDDC built on VMware NSX including how to extend the benefits of micro-segmentation with advanced security controls that enable elastic protection throughout the life-cycle of a VM. In addition, they will describe how they protect their virtualized servers, VDI desktops and cloud environments, all through a single integrated platform.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 14:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 15:28:35","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"58 Minutes 35 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/230ed7e1b946466f93f0dc8fbcd2eca61d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/230ed7e1b946466f93f0dc8fbcd2eca61d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/230ed7e1b946466f93f0dc8fbcd2eca61d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/230ed7e1b946466f93f0dc8fbcd2eca61d/f4f8e44d-09e7-4f9f-b7a2-86503668fe29_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/230ed7e1b946466f93f0dc8fbcd2eca61d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"39b19b2459764403b8f7c6f2bb26d5422a","Name":"Jon Oltsik, ESG, Moderator","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jon Oltsik, ESG, Moderator","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-879944381,"ParentResource":"230ed7e1-b946-466f-93f0-dc8fbcd2eca6"},{"Id":"502f2849d20c47d18885b720cae27a312a","Name":"Randy Evans, Integra Networks","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Randy Evans, Integra Networks","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1262987602,"ParentResource":"230ed7e1-b946-466f-93f0-dc8fbcd2eca6"},{"Id":"649ad0fcbf4a4ed6be65f328feaad2a22a","Name":"Stephen Koch, University of Pittsburgh","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Stephen Koch, University of Pittsburgh","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-306291588,"ParentResource":"230ed7e1-b946-466f-93f0-dc8fbcd2eca6"},{"Id":"94e7d139454945bd93feac2acd9d8f492a","Name":"Michael Mossal, JOIN Experience","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Michael Mossal, JOIN Experience","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1243821251,"ParentResource":"230ed7e1-b946-466f-93f0-dc8fbcd2eca6"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Panel Discussion"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":4},{"Id":"71365a8a98bc4a988983e405469b487a1d","Name":"NET8734 - Automating Networking and Security Operations with NSX Customer Panel","PresentationRootId":"71365a8a-98bc-4a98-8983-e405469b487a","Description":"Many customers are using VMware NSX to automate their networking and security operations, bringing the speed and agility to adapt to shifting demands and priorities of business, and the consistency needed to ensure a high quality of service, all while reducing operational expenses and without compromising on security.

In order to optimize the benefits of the Software-Defined Data Center, security requirements must be addressed in an automated, integrated manner without impacting features or performance. Join us to learn about real-life lessons from the trenches of Check Point vSEC and VMware NSX based customers who are paving the way to fully realize the benefits of a Software Define Datacenter \u0026ndash; without compromising on their security. See a live demo of how seamless and easy it is to auto-provision security, detect and quarantine infected machines and centrally manage your virtual and physical environments.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"4:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 16:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 16:53:22","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"53 Minutes 22 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/e95ed31bce0f466fbeb7f9056527b4281d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/e95ed31bce0f466fbeb7f9056527b4281d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/e95ed31bce0f466fbeb7f9056527b4281d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e95ed31bce0f466fbeb7f9056527b4281d/17c616f0-b899-406f-93f4-e707cf772847_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e95ed31bce0f466fbeb7f9056527b4281d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"c44ab4ee48a84f8d93f6c9a925fae3f12a","Name":"Erez Berkner, Check Point","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Erez Berkner, Check Point","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":372001873,"ParentResource":"e95ed31b-ce0f-466f-beb7-f9056527b428"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":1},{"Id":"988af0abd8be485aae2a0dbfbd34252c1d","Name":"SEC9618-SPO - Deep Dive:  Extending L4-L7 Security Controls for VMware NSX and VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) Environments with Fortinet Next Generation Security","PresentationRootId":"988af0ab-d8be-485a-ae2a-0dbfbd34252c","Description":"Are you an adopter of VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO)?

The technology has found a wide range of applications across use cases that range from automation to microsegmentation to data center pooling and disaster recovery. So what\u0027s next for network virtualization? This technical deep dive will take an \u0026quot;under the hood\u0026quot; look at network virtualization, examining the underlying architecture and its ongoing evolution. We will look at how the system is becoming more scalable through the use of clustering and the division of labor between the management, control, and data planes. The Data Plane Development Kit and flow caching are being used to boost data plane performance. We will discuss the evolution of the logical routing architecture, which will allow more complex routing topologies. Throughout the presentation, we\u0027ll tie the technical material to the expanding set of use cases that network virtualization is addressing and show how we will deliver networking and security services to any workload, anywhere\u0026mdash;across hypervisors, across multiple clouds, and to a wide range of endpoints.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 14:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 14:59:25","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"59 Minutes 25 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c6dfdf45950148a4a863d2c69a9357c11d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c6dfdf45950148a4a863d2c69a9357c11d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/c6dfdf45950148a4a863d2c69a9357c11d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c6dfdf45950148a4a863d2c69a9357c11d/bac7ab48-7c4d-4d84-8602-cdd28898f771_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c6dfdf45950148a4a863d2c69a9357c11d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"a39f1c238ed745928ac82293987348e62a","Name":"Bruce Davie, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Bruce Davie, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":763126016,"ParentResource":"c6dfdf45-9501-48a4-a863-d2c69a9357c1"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"," Networking and Security"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":220},{"Id":"14e90fd2ac4645f0825c828ea462304c1d","Name":"SEC7836R - Introduction to Security with VMware NSX","PresentationRootId":"14e90fd2-ac46-45f0-825c-828ea462304c","Description":"VMware NSX is the network and security virtualization platform for the Software-Defined Data Center.

Micro-segmentation allows automated and \u0026ldquo;baked-in\u0026rdquo; security, enabling significant security benefits as organizations move to an increasingly fine-grained segmentation approach for data-center security (e.g., Zero-Trust Architecture). This method wraps security controls around much smaller groups of resources \u0026ndash; often down to a small group of resources or individual virtual machines. The inherent security and automation capabilities of the NSX platform makes micro-segmentation operationally feasible in the enterprise data center for the first time.

This represents a major shift away from vertically integrated solutions, which have proven to be inflexible and extremely expensive to maintain. Underpinning this transformation is vSphere, which is seen as a standard building block on which to create a software-defined future. The first phase has been to deploy several cloud platforms in conjunction with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (for development/test/production). VMware NSX has been used as the key enabler to automate the build of the environments, as well as to provide micro-segmentation between the stages, thus creating an integrated but secure environment that will allow the MOD to migrate applications through the development lifecycle. In addition, HPE is using NSX to provide internal security for the software-defined data centers that they are deploying into overseas military bases (NSX, vSphere, vSAN, vROPs). In doing so, they are extending the life of existing infrastructure, deferring spend on physical firewalls and netting millions of dollars in savings.\n \nThis technical deep dive will go into why this new approach was a necessity, and how HPE and VMware worked together to provide an integrated solution: HPE cloud automation with VMware NSX, vROPS, and vSAN.","AirDateDisplay":"Sunday, August 28, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/28/2016 13:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/28/2016 13:33:04","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"33 Minutes 4 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/a2c8ed946747495598d63248694b5d2f1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/a2c8ed946747495598d63248694b5d2f1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a2c8ed946747495598d63248694b5d2f1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a2c8ed946747495598d63248694b5d2f1d/805db0df-005f-40b7-9a64-56876d212ac7_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a2c8ed946747495598d63248694b5d2f1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"eb812459-8d49-44fc-beba-b57263eac0cc","Presenters":[{"Id":"63bfce44482b448fa0bb55e64172557d2a","Name":",","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":",","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1037749148,"ParentResource":"a2c8ed94-6747-4955-98d6-3248694b5d2f"},{"Id":"715a7aad6c054f94a85522048cc3f3902a","Name":"Amarjit Manic, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Amarjit Manic, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-2082434640,"ParentResource":"a2c8ed94-6747-4955-98d6-3248694b5d2f"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Networking and Security"," Quick Talk"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":6},{"Id":"4526c3e0a7b44e4bac691e1201c094b91d","Name":"NET7774 - Day Two NSX Operations in VMware\u0027s Private Cloud","PresentationRootId":"4526c3e0-a7b4-4e4b-ac69-1e1201c094b9","Description":"With great scale comes great responsibility for uptime, environment health, and maintenance.
