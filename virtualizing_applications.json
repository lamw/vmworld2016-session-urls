Hyper-converged solutions integrate computers, networking, virtualization, flash storage, and management in one platform that accelerates deployment. In this session, we evaluate each component layer of these new hyper-converged technologies per the Oracle contract, with an eye to reducing rather than increasing database licensing quantities. We drill down on VMware Corporation\u0027s new CPU affinity statement, present the inverse relationship of DR reliability and licensing liability, point to relevant content in the May 2016 House of Brick/EMC/VMware database licensing white paper, and discuss the ramifications of the October 2015 Mars vs. Oracle lawsuit. Attending this session will give IT organizations a clear roadmap in how to manage database licensing, and next steps in the case additional resources are needed. The session concludes with a 15-minute block dedicated to answering your questions. Renowned Oracle Database licensing consultancy House of Brick hosts this session with co-presenter EMC. DBAs and others attending this session will have the knowledge to apply licensing guidelines on hyper-converged platforms like the VCE Vblock 740.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 13:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 14:47:39","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 17 Minutes 39 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c9a0b7612c5f4ca982430cc6de8174111d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c9a0b7612c5f4ca982430cc6de8174111d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c9a0b7612c5f4ca982430cc6de8174111d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c9a0b7612c5f4ca982430cc6de8174111d/c0967ea9-1a0d-4e88-9c15-1cbd190114a7_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c9a0b7612c5f4ca982430cc6de8174111d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/0e795e6393af48379bd32ee3972a903029/Presentation/c9a0b7612c5f4ca982430cc6de8174111d/3b8554f8-bca7-4850-a36f-d29322bd5775.p2g.zip?attachmentName=VIRT9034+-+Oracle+Databases+Licensing+on+a+Hyper-C.p2g.zip\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"1b0a024473a34541a92f43958c02f1882a","Name":"Nathan Biggs, House of Brick Technologies","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Nathan Biggs, House of Brick Technologies","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-701690929,"ParentResource":"c9a0b761-2c5f-4ca9-8243-0cc6de817411"},{"Id":"87496a945116463fb3d1e4b587a6553a2a","Name":"Sam Lucido, EMC","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Sam Lucido, EMC","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-395428654,"ParentResource":"c9a0b761-2c5f-4ca9-8243-0cc6de817411"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":33},{"Id":"e0cbb4b8a06048ef81f0c6c910dc11de1d","Name":"VIRT8443 - Extreme Performance Series: Evaluate the Performance of Your Cloud with Weathervane and VMware vRealize Operations","PresentationRootId":"e0cbb4b8-a060-48ef-81f0-c6c910dc11de","Description":"Is your private, public, or hybrid cloud performing to your expectations? Do you have a defined baseline for optimal application performance in your cloud environments? Application performance depends on a wide variety of factors: CPU, network and storage capabilities, overhead incurred by deploying in containers versus virtual machines, and even the speed with which you can spin up new instances to adapt to changing workloads. In order to make data-driven decisions about the selection and configuration of your infrastructure and deployment of your applications, you need tools that allow you to stress the environment in real-world ways, and measure resulting performance. In this talk we will discuss Weathervane, a performance exploration and benchmarking tool from VMware, which, together with VMware vRealize Operations Manager (vROps), can be be used to understand performance characteristics of your cloud or virtual infrastructure. Weathervaneprovides a flexible, easy-to-use benchmarking environment where you can execute load-driven scenarios containing complex multi-tier applications that can be deployed both in virtual machines and Docker containers. vROps enables you to monitor the performance characteristics of the applications and of your infrastructure in order to identify bottlenecks and represent the data needed to maximize cloud performance and efficiency. This session will provide an overview of the capabilities of Weathervaneand vROps, then demonstrate real-world scenarios that show how these tools can be used to characterize the performance of applications and virtual infrastructure. The example scenarios will identify storage bottlenecks, evaluate deployment technologies, find application-level bottlenecks, and determine the effect of infrastructure characteristics on application elasticity. You will leave this talk with an understanding of how to use Weathervaneand vROps to measure and optimize the performance of your applications and cloud infrastructure.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 13:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 14:20:56","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"50 Minutes 56 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/e0cbb4b8a06048ef81f0c6c910dc11de1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/e0cbb4b8a06048ef81f0c6c910dc11de1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e0cbb4b8a06048ef81f0c6c910dc11de1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e0cbb4b8a06048ef81f0c6c910dc11de1d/418f6da7-5b18-42c9-b556-86b6634d1db7_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/e0cbb4b8a06048ef81f0c6c910dc11de1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"3a38e53ba1194e5681bcefb181b111472a","Name":"Rebecca Grider, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Rebecca Grider, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-549539864,"ParentResource":"e0cbb4b8-a060-48ef-81f0-c6c910dc11de"},{"Id":"df937413b76849e89d6b9b9dc0fd66912a","Name":"jeff godfrey, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"jeff godfrey, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1703238835,"ParentResource":"e0cbb4b8-a060-48ef-81f0-c6c910dc11de"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":10},{"Id":"46258d1564174387b7fd8682c5cf378c1d","Name":"VIRT7620 - Successfully Virtualize and Operate Your Microsoft Skype for Business Infrastructure on the VMware vSphere Platform","PresentationRootId":"46258d15-6417-4387-b7fd-8682c5cf378c","Description":"Messaging, communication, and collaboration services that are highly scalable, available, and resilient are absolute necessities for any modern business enterprise. Microsoft Skype for Business (formerly Microsoft Lync Server) is one of the popular enterprise-level applications for achieving these goals. Concurrently, many enterprises have widely adopted virtualization as their main platform for most applications, and many more have corporate policies mandating application virtualization as a standard practice. Unfortunately, virtualizing Microsoft Skype for Business remains largely uncharted territory for most organizations, especially given the scarcity of the appropriate guidance and recommendations from the respective vendors.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 12:00:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 13:02:12","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 2 Minutes 12 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/46258d1564174387b7fd8682c5cf378c1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/46258d1564174387b7fd8682c5cf378c1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/46258d1564174387b7fd8682c5cf378c1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/46258d1564174387b7fd8682c5cf378c1d/132d8767-af4b-4203-8158-f177c84c1823_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/46258d1564174387b7fd8682c5cf378c1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"06e13f7532994c7d807434b6ebe4822e2a","Name":"Adam Ball, Strategic Products and Services","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Adam Ball, Strategic Products and Services","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-482512344,"ParentResource":"46258d15-6417-4387-b7fd-8682c5cf378c"},{"Id":"97f90fe5f34746aa86ff23163f78503f2a","Name":"Rakesh Gajwani, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Rakesh Gajwani, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1473604653,"ParentResource":"46258d15-6417-4387-b7fd-8682c5cf378c"},{"Id":"19ff34c5ec774a3e9eeec1187a8567472a","Name":"Hemal Doshi, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Hemal Doshi, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1681727835,"ParentResource":"46258d15-6417-4387-b7fd-8682c5cf378c"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":31},{"Id":"7094b8b95c7b4a5dbffcaa54551301421d","Name":"VIRT7941 - The Best of Both Words: Achieving SQL Server High Availability with VMware","PresentationRootId":"7094b8b9-5c7b-4a5d-bffc-aa5455130142","Description":"SQL Server deployments on VMware must be just as reliable and available as if installed on physical servers. The challenge is that there are two layers that could be used to provide availability - the VMware feature set, as well as the traditional options available in SQL Server including clustered instances and availability groups. Choosing the right feature - or set of features - to get the job done takes careful consideration and proper planning. One important task that must be achieved is to resolve any contention between the DBAs and the virtualization administrators. This session will demystify the SQL Server availability features, correct some common misconceptions around in-guest availability for SQL Server, and show you example architectures. You will also learn the skills to navigate the political waters of SQL Server availability and hear the best practices necessary to make SQL Server rock solid under VMware to meet your company\u0027s SQL Server availability requirements.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 12:00:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 13:00:37","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 37 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/7094b8b95c7b4a5dbffcaa54551301421d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/7094b8b95c7b4a5dbffcaa54551301421d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7094b8b95c7b4a5dbffcaa54551301421d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7094b8b95c7b4a5dbffcaa54551301421d/48f48007-2422-460d-9b2a-ec2be0f52282_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7094b8b95c7b4a5dbffcaa54551301421d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"2af6b32faea44b8fb74cfa7a452bde4a2a","Name":"Allan Hirt, SQLHA LLC","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Allan Hirt, SQLHA LLC","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-833077535,"ParentResource":"7094b8b9-5c7b-4a5d-bffc-aa5455130142"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":16},{"Id":"4fed7ffd5cb4476e8a4721dc79c134581d","Name":"VIRT8290R - Monster VMs (Database Virtualization) Doing IT Right","PresentationRootId":"4fed7ffd-5cb4-476e-8a47-21dc79c13458","Description":"Databases by their very nature are Monster VMs. If Monster VMs are not virtualized properly, they will never perform well and can negatively impact the performance of other VMs on the hosts.

Although IT administrators realize the benefits of virtualization, they may be hesitant to virtualize applications such as databases because of their resource demands, and may even fear that the underlying hypervisor will prevent the infrastructure from meeting the SLAs of these applications. VMware vSphere, the industry\u0027s leading hypervisor platform, has been pushing the boundaries of infrastructure resources it can manage over various releases. With its superior resource management capabilities, vSphere can easily scale horizontally to support many virtual machines (VMs) or vertically to support large VMs. vSphere 6 introduces the ability to run virtual machines with up to 128 virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and 4TB of RAM, allowing extreme resource-hungry applications such as databases to be run in VMs. In this talk, the speakers give an overview of key vSphere features such as CPU and NUMA schedulers, and memory managers that propel monster VMs. The speakers will share their benchmark results, experience gained, and lessons learned. A deep dive into Oracle and SQL Server scalability on vSphere 6 on a large, multi-core physical host (4 CPU, 1 TB RAM) will be presented. Finally, the speakers will provide best practices to the audience for undertaking such an exercise. This talk should alleviate any hesitation to migrate resource-hungry, mission-critical database applications to a private cloud.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 14:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 15:38:31","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 8 Minutes 31 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/6b0b4ee7de5b4c00942251914481bbf91d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/6b0b4ee7de5b4c00942251914481bbf91d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/6b0b4ee7de5b4c00942251914481bbf91d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/6b0b4ee7de5b4c00942251914481bbf91d/8964d9cd-1e8f-4bfb-b0b8-17c907746c38_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/6b0b4ee7de5b4c00942251914481bbf91d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"8b7c22d8bfb44822aa4a812c3de8d05c2a","Name":"Todd Muirhead, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Todd Muirhead, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-481763196,"ParentResource":"6b0b4ee7-de5b-4c00-9422-51914481bbf9"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":28},{"Id":"918b41f5410748d59d89ebb4b54286951d","Name":"VIRT7840 - VMware and Microsoft Present: Successfully Virtualizing Microsoft Exchange Server, the Right Way","PresentationRootId":"918b41f5-4107-48d5-9d89-ebb4b5428695","Description":"Microsoft Exchange Server is the most widely deployed email system in the world.

Microsoft and VMware are combining efforts to help our joint customers avoid these challenges by providing comprehensive, concise, and streamlined prescriptive guidance and recommendations founded on our combined expertise and experience in the relevant technologies and solutions.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 14:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 15:29:23","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"59 Minutes 23 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/918b41f5410748d59d89ebb4b54286951d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/918b41f5410748d59d89ebb4b54286951d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/918b41f5410748d59d89ebb4b54286951d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/918b41f5410748d59d89ebb4b54286951d/06452061-2fe1-49f1-8400-675041312954_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/918b41f5410748d59d89ebb4b54286951d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/0e795e6393af48379bd32ee3972a903029/Presentation/918b41f5410748d59d89ebb4b54286951d/ecf00513-6bff-4499-b56b-decc5a67d3f6.p2g.zip?attachmentName=VIRT7840+-+VMware+and+Microsoft+Present%253a+Successfu.p2g.zip\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"18be2bef73a44bf88250f42b86b57f1f2a","Name":"Jeff Mealiffe, Microsoft Corporation","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jeff Mealiffe, Microsoft Corporation","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1190050125,"ParentResource":"918b41f5-4107-48d5-9d89-ebb4b5428695"},{"Id":"3d6b13719d0241ceb952b5077f316cfb2a","Name":"Deji Akomolafe, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Deji Akomolafe, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1779979194,"ParentResource":"918b41f5-4107-48d5-9d89-ebb4b5428695"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":21},{"Id":"5d4571797dc44f0ba64d00fa473b0a511d","Name":"VIRT9402-SPO - Modern Storage Strategies for On-Demand Applications","PresentationRootId":"5d457179-7dc4-4f0b-a64d-00fa473b0a51","Description":"If software is eating the world, SaaS is eating software. Modern businesses are re-writing the rules of application delivery and deployment. As application development cycles become more agile to accommodate rapidly evolving business requirements, enterprises increasingly rely on flexible, scalable cloud delivered applications. Strategies for building modern infrastructures for cloud-delivered applications must be rooted in flexibility, agility, and scalability.\n\nThis discussion will explore how datacenter technologies like virtualization, containerization, and highly scalable database platforms drive and enable IT infrastructure that delivers applications-as-a-service. SaaS businesses\u0026rsquo; pay-as-you go model requires virtualization at the compute layer for servers and desktops. Scaling up and down, to meet application user demand requires flexible compute deployments that greatly benefit from containerization. As the data foundation for the online business, storage must deliver scale and performance as the compute paradigm evolves, while cost-effectively providing continuous data availability.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 14:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 14:54:27","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"54 Minutes 27 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/5d4571797dc44f0ba64d00fa473b0a511d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/5d4571797dc44f0ba64d00fa473b0a511d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5d4571797dc44f0ba64d00fa473b0a511d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5d4571797dc44f0ba64d00fa473b0a511d/8045f3e1-6ef5-4065-a10a-dde9253271fc_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5d4571797dc44f0ba64d00fa473b0a511d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"281f00a1720b4f6b8d1bfc3af1827f662a","Name":"Eric Burgener, IDC","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Eric Burgener, IDC","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1230299776,"ParentResource":"5d457179-7dc4-4f0b-a64d-00fa473b0a51"},{"Id":"3f180eae98524ca484ad26911973caf32a","Name":"Sundip Arora, Kaminario","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Sundip Arora, Kaminario","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":52746707,"ParentResource":"5d457179-7dc4-4f0b-a64d-00fa473b0a51"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":1},{"Id":"b5378da5405b44589e7ca17e16c379941d","Name":"VIRT8074 - The SDDC: Full Stack on vSphere 6.0 SAP Business Warehouse Powered By HANA, NSX,  vRealize Operations, SDS-Virtual Volumes on Hitachi Unified Platform","PresentationRootId":"b5378da5-405b-4458-9e7c-a17e16c37994","Description":"This Software-Defined Data Center is no longer a concept, it is reality.

By leveraging VMware virtualization products, customers benefit from increased security and built-in multi-tenancy support, abstraction of the hardware layer, higher hardware utilization rates, and easier management by, for instance, live migration of running SAP applications and databases. All this is lowering the total cost of ownership and providing better SLAs and flexibility. With Virtual SAN 6 and newer, VMware now provides the next step in infrastructure virtualization. By leveraging server internal disks and flash devices, very cost-efficient enterprise-ready virtual SAN storage configurations can be built and operated. \n\nIn this session, a test and demo environment of four server systems, configured with all flash Virtual SAN datastores, will be presented to show how easy and cost efficient it is to provide a IOPS cluster capacity of over 180,000 IOPS for a typical SAP workload, with 4/8k blocks and 70% read and 30% write operations, and IO latencies of 4 concurrent high loaded running VMs below 610 microseconds. We will also explain in detail how to configure a SAP Virtual SAN environment that fulfills the IO performance, reliability, and business requirements organizations request to operate SAP systems that are cost efficient, reliable, and secure. We will provide best practices and lessons learned. A SAP-specific sizing example concludes this session.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 17:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 18:02:43","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 2 Minutes 43 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/0bc21bd768c14320b76110b863868c941d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/0bc21bd768c14320b76110b863868c941d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/0bc21bd768c14320b76110b863868c941d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/0bc21bd768c14320b76110b863868c941d/0c7df0b6-074c-473e-ab35-c889fb032cc1_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/0bc21bd768c14320b76110b863868c941d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"89d8508eb49144e389e0abd7eda7f8082a","Name":"Erik Rieger, VMware Global Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Erik Rieger, VMware Global Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1490911097,"ParentResource":"0bc21bd7-68c1-4320-b761-10b863868c94"},{"Id":"db2eab97a2cf49458bf548500727f7462a","Name":"Chen Wei, vmware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Chen Wei, vmware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":212156692,"ParentResource":"0bc21bd7-68c1-4320-b761-10b863868c94"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Virtualizing Applications"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":5},{"Id":"d31ea1eddcaf4b198a19c178bd4fdc501d","Name":"VIRT8530R - Deep Dive on pNUMA \u0026 vNUMA - Save Your SQL VMs from Certain DoomA!","PresentationRootId":"d31ea1ed-dcaf-4b19-8a19-c178bd4fdc50","Description":"There\u0027s more to non-uniform memory access (NUMA) than physical boundaries in your server hardware.

Adding in VMware vSphere to make Hadoop work in a virtualized environment is another layer of operations. Between the two platforms, there could be tens of thousands of parameters to be tweaked and managed to make sure that optimal configurations are applied across the stack. Some parameters will be more critical than others. Understanding where the parameters need to be capped is also important.\n\nHaving Hadoop admin and vSphere admin establish a cohesive support model is key to managing the Hadoop platform successfully.

Traditionally this has been done using backup and recovery or copying snapshots of the database to refresh the different copies of the database.This session looks at how VMware vRealize automation combined with All Flash Storage can revolutionize database operations and business intelligence applications. Maintaining high performance, efficient environments for mission-critical applications can be a huge challenge for IT departments. Balancing high availability for production operations with agility for application development efforts can be extremely tricky. Developers need fast access to the latest application configurations and data to ensure that new apps/services are delivered to specification. IT departments have to find a way to maintain business SLAs, while supporting innovation through developer agility. In this session, we will explore an architectural model, with vRealize Automation and All Flash Storage, that allows IT departments to support production application SLAs, while at the same time driving higher levels of developer agility to drive innovation. The speakers will discuss: - Challenges with day-to-day operations for enterprise applications - Some unique characteristics of vRealize Automation and Pure Storage FlashArray that can help with application operations -

It is no longer an issue whether a tier-1 workload can be virtualized, but rather there are companies that are betting their tier-0 on the VMware stack. Soci\u0026eacute;t\u0026eacute; G\u0026eacute;n\u0026eacute;rale (formerly NewEdge) is one such company, with their main trading platform called NVision running on a fully virtualized cluster servicing some 20 million trades per day. This session will cover various platform architectures that are used, with deep dive into the cluster design for this trading platform. The session will share many best practices and actual examples used with customers that are running such high-end platforms. Specifically, Java Garbage Collection, in-memory databases, vSphere tuning techniques, and rationalization of large deployments having 1000s of VMs and JVMs will be discussed.

With the release of vSphere 6 in 2015 it is fair to say that every application and database in existence is a candidate for virtualized infrastructure. There are many types of applications and databases and VMware has just as many approaches to running them all in the SDDC. Also these databases and database applications can be offered through self‐service portal architectures, all of which can be managed through a Database-as-a-Service approach that eliminate or minimize IT intervention. Providing multiple copies of relational database servers for testing and development is often a complex operation but through hybrid cloud architectures this model can be extremely effective and efficient. This session will discuss the overall VMware approach to BCA as well as the notions of DbaaS.","AirDateDisplay":"Sunday, August 28, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"4:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/28/2016 16:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/28/2016 16:31:23","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"31 Minutes 23 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/fd739b62e77646eead2bcfcdaf7b0de21d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/fd739b62e77646eead2bcfcdaf7b0de21d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/fd739b62e77646eead2bcfcdaf7b0de21d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/fd739b62e77646eead2bcfcdaf7b0de21d/7e415eb3-7ebf-4b58-8f48-67424cd21266_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/fd739b62e77646eead2bcfcdaf7b0de21d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"1017df70-d968-4546-8b02-32e7722fc614","Presenters":[{"Id":"84d683ba896348afbca1a62b49749b1a2a","Name":"Kannan Mani, HPE","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Kannan Mani, HPE","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-615217311,"ParentResource":"fd739b62-e776-46ee-ad2b-cfcdaf7b0de2"},{"Id":"c12f77e3063348ebac94154c9efce9522a","Name":"Deji Akomolafe, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Deji Akomolafe, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1779979194,"ParentResource":"fd739b62-e776-46ee-ad2b-cfcdaf7b0de2"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Virtualizing Applications"," Quick Talk"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":13},{"Id":"0b1fc07fef234d559d54860f6a7308c71d","Name":"VIRT8239-QT - Things You Should Know about Big Data","PresentationRootId":"0b1fc07f-ef23-4d55-9d54-860f6a7308c7","Description":"Big Data is one of the most fast-moving technologies that supports new disruptive businesses.
