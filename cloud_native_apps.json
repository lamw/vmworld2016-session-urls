Running Docker on Your Existing Infrastructure with vSphere Integrated Containers","PresentationRootId":"36a770c2-6ebb-4467-849a-c7e87cfa950c","Description":"Docker has taken the IT world by storm and is now one of the most popular tools with which to deploy applications. Over the last three years it has gained a lot of momentum with developers. They use Docker to build and deploy applications. But what works fine in a developer environment needs to be taken into production at some point. That is when IT operations take over and need to figure out how to run Docker containers within the infrastructure. The question then becomes: How do you run Docker containers on your existing VMware vSphere infrastructure? That is where vSphere Integrated Containers comes into play. In this session we will walk you through the architecture of how to run Docker on vSphere with vSphere Integrated Containers. We will give you an introduction on how the technology works and how vSphere Integrated Containers is different from running containers without the tight integration with vSphere. We will show you that vSphere Integrated Containers is the ideal way to host Docker containers on vSphere and that it does not change anything for the people who consume Docker containers, but gives IT operations the tools that it already knows to manage the vSphere environment. We will also demo how vSphere Integrated Containers works and share with you the best practices that we have gained in the field over the last year at enterprise customers. With this shared knowledge and expertise, hopefully you will be able to design and implement vSphere Integrated Containers in your environment.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:00 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 11:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 12:12:39","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 12 Minutes 39 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/36a770c26ebb4467849ac7e87cfa950c1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/36a770c26ebb4467849ac7e87cfa950c1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/36a770c26ebb4467849ac7e87cfa950c1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/36a770c26ebb4467849ac7e87cfa950c1d/9c1207fa-22aa-42d8-865f-9fd6796c5cd6_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/36a770c26ebb4467849ac7e87cfa950c1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"752e390c-374a-4495-83fa-a9d7c650dc3d","Presenters":[{"Id":"61e587ba30654d108674e64a2ba799e22a","Name":"Paul Gifford, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Paul Gifford, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-273166990,"ParentResource":"36a770c2-6ebb-4467-849a-c7e87cfa950c"},{"Id":"fbfdf814063c45d0847ac1471cee0df22a","Name":"Martijn Baecke, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Martijn Baecke, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2057261812,"ParentResource":"36a770c2-6ebb-4467-849a-c7e87cfa950c"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced","Cloud Native Apps"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":41},{"Id":"810fdcdfe91a49d0a581f55ce019bd3c1d","Name":"CNA8313 - Your Open-Source Data Center","PresentationRootId":"810fdcdf-e91a-49d0-a581-f55ce019bd3c","Description":"As you deploy your services, see how you can easily treat everything from bare-metal servers, virtual machines, and containers as versioned software-defined infrastructure building blocks. Unleash the power of the VMware Photon Platform on your cloud-native applications and EM RackHD, which seamlessly orchestrates the physical infrastructure. By bringing these two game changers together, you apply the malleability of software to any class of hardware in a way that allows you to expose unique physical characteristics for specific workloads such as Hadoop or other distributed services transparently and predictably. You can further provide developers with the ability to experiment and have direct API access to modern application infrastructure stacks, be they Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Cloud Foundry, without rescinding the key needs of an enterprise of control, multitenancy, and security auditability. This session is a demo-driven, very practical application of open-source projects across VMware, EMC, Apache Foundation, and Google that make software-defined and developer-accessible infrastructure a reality.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"9:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 09:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 10:16:51","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"46 Minutes 51 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/810fdcdfe91a49d0a581f55ce019bd3c1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/810fdcdfe91a49d0a581f55ce019bd3c1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/810fdcdfe91a49d0a581f55ce019bd3c1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/810fdcdfe91a49d0a581f55ce019bd3c1d/1a669528-2f7b-4cd2-8ac6-902e86bbf794_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/810fdcdfe91a49d0a581f55ce019bd3c1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"752e390c-374a-4495-83fa-a9d7c650dc3d","Presenters":[{"Id":"59755a92d85744e89d217a2017cdffa72a","Name":"David Lloyd, EMC Australia","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"David Lloyd, EMC Australia","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1121850141,"ParentResource":"810fdcdf-e91a-49d0-a581-f55ce019bd3c"},{"Id":"9cf679f4a5e549bbbc2518185e4a63982a","Name":"Roman Tarnavski, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Roman Tarnavski, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-178638576,"ParentResource":"810fdcdf-e91a-49d0-a581-f55ce019bd3c"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced","Cloud Native Apps"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":9},{"Id":"1ebdf6012d9c4df3b1d929c211ad939e1d","Name":"CNA7524 - Photon Platform, vSphere, or Both?","PresentationRootId":"1ebdf601-2d9c-4df3-b1d9-29c211ad939e","Description":"VMware recently introduced a high-scale, high-churn cloud-native solution in the form of VMware Photon Platform.

In this session, we will share considerations for running containers in a private cloud: how to successfully build out DevOps-relevant practices to engage developers as well as business units, how to adapt IT security policies around containers, and how to make sure your platform fits the needs of internal and external consumers.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"8:00 AM CDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 08:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 09:00:42","TimeZoneId":"19","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 42 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/0336dc864fed4321940f89595540afef1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/0336dc864fed4321940f89595540afef1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/0336dc864fed4321940f89595540afef1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/0336dc864fed4321940f89595540afef1d/bb41271a-6c84-4be6-a60e-38213b9fa507_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/0336dc864fed4321940f89595540afef1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Video (Composite Video)","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/0336dc864fed4321940f89595540afef1d/ddfd5fad-fd34-4b04-affc-8c00c927ad9e.mp4?attachmentName=CNA8578+-+VMware+Private+Cloud+and+Containers+in+P.mp4\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":107,"FolderId":"752e390c-374a-4495-83fa-a9d7c650dc3d","Presenters":[{"Id":"fd53213422c54426852a43647b36c70a2a","Name":"Bjoern Brundert, VMware Global, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Bjoern Brundert, VMware Global, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-975262623,"ParentResource":"0336dc86-4fed-4321-940f-89595540afef"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" VMworld"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session","Cloud Native Apps"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":0},{"Id":"310a7742438446a283b9f1904b70ee321d","Name":"CNA8145 - From Today to \u0027\u0027CNA\u0027\u0027: VMware Technologies and DevOps Frameworks as a Service","PresentationRootId":"310a7742-4384-46a2-83b9-f1904b70ee32","Description":"Operations teams are receiving pressure by developers to support DevOps, Platform as a Service (\u0026ldquo;PaaS\u0026rdquo;), Containers, Microservices, Cloud Native Applications (\u0026ldquo;CNA\u0026rdquo;) and other new software delivery strategies. On the other hand, operations teams seek clarity on how current VMware infrastructure, governance, security, stability, operational management and related topics fit what development pushes. At the same time, VMware is bringing to market new CNA solutions like vSphere Integrated Containers and Photon Platform, yet vSphere, vRealize Automation, VMware Integrated OpenStack and others still form the basis of enterprise operational infrastructures.

Over the last three years it has gained a lot of momentum with developers. They use Docker to build and deploy applications. But what works fine in a developer environment needs to be taken into production at some point. That is when IT operations take over and need to figure out how to run Docker containers within the infrastructure. The question then becomes: How do you run Docker containers on your existing VMware vSphere infrastructure? That is where vSphere Integrated Containers comes into play. In this session we will walk you through the architecture of how to run Docker on vSphere with vSphere Integrated Containers. We will give you an introduction on how the technology works and how vSphere Integrated Containers is different from running containers without the tight integration with vSphere. We will show you that vSphere Integrated Containers is the ideal way to host Docker containers on vSphere and that it does not change anything for the people who consume Docker containers, but gives IT operations the tools that it already knows to manage the vSphere environment. We will also demo how vSphere Integrated Containers works and share with you the best practices that we have gained in the field over the last year at enterprise customers. With this shared knowledge and expertise, hopefully you will be able to design and implement vSphere Integrated Containers in your environment.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 13:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 13:58:25","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"58 Minutes 25 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/fcf1cf8a23f94d51a710aecb297108091d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/fcf1cf8a23f94d51a710aecb297108091d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/fcf1cf8a23f94d51a710aecb297108091d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/fcf1cf8a23f94d51a710aecb297108091d/b7955ef0-b58e-4c91-ac44-75bd888b58f0_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/fcf1cf8a23f94d51a710aecb297108091d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"752e390c-374a-4495-83fa-a9d7c650dc3d","Presenters":[{"Id":"9648a266ff204c12813ae48f8d06ebcb2a","Name":"Paul Gifford, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Paul Gifford, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-273166990,"ParentResource":"fcf1cf8a-23f9-4d51-a710-aecb29710809"},{"Id":"bc7ed54cadda40c38229cf83205f0fc62a","Name":"Martijn Baecke, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Martijn Baecke, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2057261812,"ParentResource":"fcf1cf8a-23f9-4d51-a710-aecb29710809"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced","Cloud Native Apps"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":264},{"Id":"ff8d9df7ba5f47f3b97b3227215c95321d","Name":"MGT7804 - Container Management with vRealize Automation","PresentationRootId":"ff8d9df7-ba5f-47f3-b97b-3227215c9532","Description":"Containers are transforming the way we build and deploy applications.
