In recent years, VMware has added support for extensibility through vRealize Operations, but this was always cumbersome and hard to extend without intimate knowledge of the process or a professional services organization engagement. vRealize Automation 7.0 introduced the Event Broker, which makes this very simple while also allowing workflows to be fired from more points in the deployment lifecycle. Come meet with the team that runs the vRealize Automation dogfooding deployment (a.k.a., Project Cava) and that has transitioned their extensive vRealize Operations customization from the workflow stubs to the Event Broker in order to make for simpler integration. This has made blueprint development and troubleshooting much easier and given the team many more extensibility points than were previously available.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 12:00:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 13:08:09","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 8 Minutes 9 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/10d1cd626b8a4e459109882c39e6362e1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/10d1cd626b8a4e459109882c39e6362e1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/10d1cd626b8a4e459109882c39e6362e1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/10d1cd626b8a4e459109882c39e6362e1d/2d23ea5a-9b06-4f21-9aef-c273507fa3e8_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/10d1cd626b8a4e459109882c39e6362e1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"68487178-ce20-495d-8cad-5c69cf2b79db","Presenters":[{"Id":"73438c4d8b4d4289b231dbda14f1db292a","Name":"Daniel Zilberman, VMWare inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Daniel Zilberman, VMWare inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-639245721,"ParentResource":"10d1cd62-6b8a-4e45-9109-882c39e6362e"},{"Id":"ab0f31657b1248a386e74497cc4820072a","Name":"Bryan Halter, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Bryan Halter, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1723894899,"ParentResource":"10d1cd62-6b8a-4e45-9109-882c39e6362e"},{"Id":"45bad74315e5443abd369ed84e038ae52a","Name":"Savina Ilieva, VMware Inc","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Savina Ilieva, VMware Inc","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1778397007,"ParentResource":"10d1cd62-6b8a-4e45-9109-882c39e6362e"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Cloud Management","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":34},{"Id":"7cfa48e47f6f4e6688df040a739a2db01d","Name":"MGT7770 - Virtual SAN Management – Time to Level Up Your Ops Game!","PresentationRootId":"7cfa48e4-7f6f-4e66-88df-040a739a2db0","Description":"VMware Virtual SAN: You trust its proven ability to run your enterprise applications, top to bottom. You embraced it for your remote office/branch office environments and love its stretched cluster capabilities. And don\u0027t get us started on the new dedupe, compression, and erasure coding features in Virtual SAN 6.2. What more could you ask for? How about taking Virtual SAN operations and management to the next level? Yes, the new Virtual SAN management tools built into VMware vCenter provide excellent preflight checks and ongoing insight into Virtual SAN health and performance. But perhaps you need more sophisticated enterprisewide visibility into all of your Virtual SAN environments in one place. Do you need to see performance analytics over time as well as capacity trending and modeling for each of your Virtual SAN environments? Would you like to visualize your underlying physical network health and performance to see if it is impacting Virtual SAN latency? How about a correlated line of site from your virtual machines through the entire topology of your Virtual SAN components? VMware vRealize Operations Manager plus the Management Pack for Storage Devices (MPSD) is the level-up for your Virtual SAN ops game! We will provide live demonstrations of all of these management tools and compare use cases for each solution to help you determine what makes the most sense for your implementation and operational goals. You will walk away Virtual SAN smarter.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"10:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 10:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 11:24:58","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"54 Minutes 58 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/7cfa48e47f6f4e6688df040a739a2db01d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/7cfa48e47f6f4e6688df040a739a2db01d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/7cfa48e47f6f4e6688df040a739a2db01d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7cfa48e47f6f4e6688df040a739a2db01d/5c60aa72-ba3d-453c-b927-8450d1d7b91c_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7cfa48e47f6f4e6688df040a739a2db01d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"68487178-ce20-495d-8cad-5c69cf2b79db","Presenters":[{"Id":"392e2a60c77c40c9896574ecfbf8d2cc2a","Name":"jeff godfrey, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"jeff godfrey, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1703238835,"ParentResource":"7cfa48e4-7f6f-4e66-88df-040a739a2db0"},{"Id":"c02eb22c549046c383c8ff3b9f3607b42a","Name":"Rawlinson Rivera, VMware, Inc","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Rawlinson Rivera, VMware, Inc","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-62374412,"ParentResource":"7cfa48e4-7f6f-4e66-88df-040a739a2db0"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Cloud Management","Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":12},{"Id":"828d9c2db8994f8686c6102ffc459ce71d","Name":"MGT7751R - A Technical Deep Dive into VMware Integrated OpenStack","PresentationRootId":"828d9c2d-b899-4f86-86c6-102ffc459ce7","Description":"You may have tried deploying OpenStack either from Operating System package managers or from OpenStack distribution vendors.

So how can we quickly determine the root cause of an issue? Utilizing VMware vRealize Operations as a data aggregator, we are able to collectively assemble key performance indicators and relevant data in a single-management user interface. The robust user interface provides an all-encompassing view by automatically mapping dependencies within an environment and aggregating data in a single location. The dependencies and data aggregation provide a detailed level of insight from the application/database through the virtual layer and down to the underlying hardware. Using vRealize Operations, we are able to quickly access data across endpoints, determine the impact they impose on the rest of the environment, and quickly determine the root cause of an issue.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"8:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 08:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 09:15:28","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"45 Minutes 28 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/18e1f4d9630748d3bff6beb18de5292c1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/18e1f4d9630748d3bff6beb18de5292c1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/18e1f4d9630748d3bff6beb18de5292c1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/18e1f4d9630748d3bff6beb18de5292c1d/20195356-6e0b-4f22-a19e-d9869a765182_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/18e1f4d9630748d3bff6beb18de5292c1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"68487178-ce20-495d-8cad-5c69cf2b79db","Presenters":[{"Id":"1d17fc34b04240dc9b1047b1c862ce022a","Name":"Chuck Petrie, Blue Medora","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Chuck Petrie, Blue Medora","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-2066100629,"ParentResource":"18e1f4d9-6307-48d3-bff6-beb18de5292c"},{"Id":"820a5206756e42599b1cb91c6e4d1ae52a","Name":"Donald Schubot, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Donald Schubot, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2081811430,"ParentResource":"18e1f4d9-6307-48d3-bff6-beb18de5292c"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Cloud Management","Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":9},{"Id":"00975846e03a4e50812ddc97c7deeec31d","Name":"MGT9457 - Understanding the Value of vRealize Network Insight","PresentationRootId":"00975846-e03a-4e50-812d-dc97c7deeec3","Description":"As you know, VMware had recently acquired Arkin for its top-notch NSX management tools.

Because every application release process has its own set of tools and nuances, how do you tie them all into a single, coherent release process? You need an overarching solution that takes all your release tools and processes and strings them up into an automation instrument for push-button application deployment confidence and end-to-end visibility. VMware vRealize Code Stream is one such solution that releases automation and, at the same time, integrates deeply with other VMware automation products such as vRealize Automation and vRealize Orchestrator along with many of the other tools in your typical SDLC environment. vRealize Code Stream 2.1 is hot off the press and packed with lots of exciting improvements\u0026mdash;it\u0027s our best release yet. We have achieved significant changes under the hood that will further enhance the speed at which you can deliver your applications, and to top it off, we have added more third-party integration and reporting capabilities. In this session, you will get an overview of all the new capabilities we offer in vRealize Code Stream 2.1, including a detailed walkthrough of all the new third-party integrations and the improvements made to application release visibility through reporting. We\u0027ll also demo how a release pipeline can take a developer-initiated application change through various stages of a typical release process, including automated testing, staging, and finally production. This presentation will also show how the integration mechanisms of vRealize Code Stream work together with both VMware and third-party tools.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 17:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 17:57:25","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"57 Minutes 25 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/b9f093e99cb443a8bd6864343c59aa261d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/b9f093e99cb443a8bd6864343c59aa261d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/b9f093e99cb443a8bd6864343c59aa261d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b9f093e99cb443a8bd6864343c59aa261d/4f5fbe63-9498-4b5a-9b1c-c3fb71159d3f_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b9f093e99cb443a8bd6864343c59aa261d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"68487178-ce20-495d-8cad-5c69cf2b79db","Presenters":[{"Id":"28d3f38ab4d945df85d11baf2464d2112a","Name":"Kim Ranyard, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Kim Ranyard, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1252033106,"ParentResource":"b9f093e9-9cb4-43a8-bd68-64343c59aa26"},{"Id":"73832a52a26241139c06a7bbf9c4c5b92a","Name":"Vishal Jain, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Vishal Jain, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2093947470,"ParentResource":"b9f093e9-9cb4-43a8-bd68-64343c59aa26"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Cloud Management","Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":3},{"Id":"ca59fdc47de44f91a603e42f3c0fe6291d","Name":"MGT8733R - Application Self-Service with On-Demand Networking \u0026 Security from vRealize Automation and NSX","PresentationRootId":"ca59fdc4-7de4-4f91-a603-e42f3c0fe629","Description":" Learn how vRealize Automation and NSX optimize IT demand by reducing delivery time from weeks to minutes.
