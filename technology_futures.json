Today, RDMA can be used only in a virtual environment via Virtual Machine (VM) Direct Path I/O or Single Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV), both of which disable the use of vMotion and snapshots, two key features of the VMware virtual platform. To fully leverage RDMA in the virtual world, VMware is developing an innovative Para-virtual Remote Direct Memory Access (PVRDMA) technology. PVRDMA provides VMs with an RDMA interface, enabling virtualized network-intensive applications to utilize the full potential of RDMA and fast interconnects, while retaining the benefits of vMotion and snapshots. With PVRDMA, VMs in a cluster can communicate with latencies close to those of non-virtualized operation systems and bandwidths identical to those of the physical RDMA hardware. This is achieved by leveraging the transport services of physical RDMA devices with low overhead while maintaining the consolidation and isolation provided by virtualization. In this session, we provide a technical deep dive of the design and use of PVRDMA, and showcase the performance achievable with this exciting technology.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 12:00:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 12:47:28","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"47 Minutes 28 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/50c46379d80742e8baf1ab881c039b041d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/50c46379d80742e8baf1ab881c039b041d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/50c46379d80742e8baf1ab881c039b041d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/50c46379d80742e8baf1ab881c039b041d/24abbd57-d589-4331-a34b-1e46900c1706_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/50c46379d80742e8baf1ab881c039b041d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"4f476ef6-4c8a-407a-9d4c-37dfab838f63","Presenters":[{"Id":"6bb671f64efc43978aeb778740aa8f0a2a","Name":"Liran Liss, Mellanox Technologies","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Liran Liss, Mellanox Technologies","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":616318197,"ParentResource":"50c46379-d807-42e8-baf1-ab881c039b04"},{"Id":"fabdbda7fc28474f81694795ffc019ab2a","Name":"Adit Ranadive, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Adit Ranadive, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1669791452,"ParentResource":"50c46379-d807-42e8-baf1-ab881c039b04"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced","Technology Futures"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":19},{"Id":"8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d","Name":"CTO8120 - Debunking the Myths about Virtualizing High Performance Computing","PresentationRootId":"8a87a260-f133-481b-9e6c-5f39472f3648","Description":"If you have islands of bare-metal infrastructure scattered around your company or institution, there is a good chance these resources are used to run extremely compute-intensive workloads in support of your organization\u0027s engineers, researchers, and scientists. These workloads -- often called High Performance Computing (HPC) or Technical Computing workloads -- run on clusters or grids and solve important (and large) technical problems, often in parallel. Over three million CPU sockets worth of server processors are sold to run these engineering, science, and research workloads every year. And yet relatively few of these processors are virtualized. Many believe these workloads cannot be virtualized due to performance issues and that there is little or no value in virtualizing these environments. In this session, two HPC experts from the VMware Office of the CTO will debunk both of these myths by presenting detailed performance data showing which workloads run best when virtualized and explaining in detail why customers are beginning to virtualize these environments and what approaches are being used to do so. Both vSphere and vRealize Automation-based approaches will be discussed, as will the potential uses of virtual SAN. Performance topics will include: throughput applications, message-passing applications, use of specialized interconnects like InfiniBand, compute accelerators such as nVidia GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi, and parallel file systems. Background information about HPC workloads and environments will be included to help non-specialists understand these concepts and to facilitate informed discussions with your organization\u0027s HPC infrastructure owners when you return from VMworld.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"9:30 AM CDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 09:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 10:27:09","TimeZoneId":"19","DurationDisplay":"57 Minutes 9 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d/57855ee1-97aa-41b4-8989-bb35ba474135_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/0e795e6393af48379bd32ee3972a903029/Presentation/8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d/50db80ca-2f49-4d61-b7d0-aa1fe03fb27f.p2g.zip?attachmentName=CTO8120+-+Debunking+the+Myths+about+Virtualizing+H.p2g.zip\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8"},{"Name":"Video (Composite Video)","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8a87a260f133481b9e6c5f39472f36481d/0de934a1-212e-452b-969a-62d7ba49d351.mp4?attachmentName=CTO8120+-+Debunking+the+Myths+about+Virtualizing+H.mp4\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":58,"FolderId":"4f476ef6-4c8a-407a-9d4c-37dfab838f63","Presenters":[{"Id":"7a04180997ce418f9acf7b1afd6bef0c2a","Name":"Na Zhang, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Na Zhang, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1311741682,"ParentResource":"8a87a260-f133-481b-9e6c-5f39472f3648"},{"Id":"2e90389253084dce92823003faa278f82a","Name":"Josh Simons, VMware, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Josh Simons, VMware, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":141737041,"ParentResource":"8a87a260-f133-481b-9e6c-5f39472f3648"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" VMworld"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session","Technology Futures"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":18},{"Id":"6e1fab3619884af794ec3bd7f2bb716c1d","Name":"CTO9942 - Multi-Cloud Mania: Practical Operations in a Multi-Cloud World","PresentationRootId":"6e1fab36-1988-4af7-94ec-3bd7f2bb716c","Description":"If you\u0026rsquo;re like most organizations, you have plans to or are already operating across multiple public and private clouds.

Analysts, industry leaders, and governments have proven that AI saves lives, money, and makes companies more competitive, yet IT departments across the globe are underutilizing AI. If you are a business person, manager in IT, or operations leader, join us for this compelling and timely session hosted by founding members of the VMware xPlorer group, a division within the Office of the CTO, whose charter is to analyze emerging technologies and trends, ultimately guiding VMware\u0027s strategic direction and critical R\u0026D initiatives. We will share with you how VMware uses AI in its tools, and what we are thinking about for the future. With large enterprises having the ability to collect terabytes of information daily from devices, servers, and things, AI will help you make better decisions and ultimately create new models that will drive your competitive edge.","AirDateDisplay":"Sunday, August 28, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/28/2016 13:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/28/2016 13:42:58","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"42 Minutes 58 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/4cbe16e9943c4af4bea3761b03db03641d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/4cbe16e9943c4af4bea3761b03db03641d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/4cbe16e9943c4af4bea3761b03db03641d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/4cbe16e9943c4af4bea3761b03db03641d/90692045-d76b-424f-9244-f91915099071_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/4cbe16e9943c4af4bea3761b03db03641d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"4f476ef6-4c8a-407a-9d4c-37dfab838f63","Presenters":[{"Id":"a28197cbf62749338a134e533bbe25c92a","Name":"Michael Gandy, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Michael Gandy, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":563467875,"ParentResource":"4cbe16e9-943c-4af4-bea3-761b03db0364"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Technology Futures"," Quick Talk"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":17}],"CurrentFolder":{"Id":"d09658e3-c26f-4238-9288-0f8a99895dbc","ParentCatalogFolderId":"ccf3adb0-c156-4815-bb02-90195c0edccc","CatalogId":"dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40","DynamicFolderId":"4f476ef6-4c8a-407a-9d4c-37dfab838f63","DynamicFolderName":null,"RootDynamicFolderId":"dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40","Name":"Technology Futures","Description":"","Type":3,"DisplayOptions":13,"Shortcut":null,"IsReadOnly":false,"Owner":"bruceh","IsStaticFolder":false,"IsDynamicFolder":false,"IsVirtualFolder":true,"IncludeSubFolders":true,"IsSearchBased":false,"LimitSearchToCatalog":true,"MyMediasiteChannel":false,"CanPublishTo":false,"IsSearchBasedCatalog":false,"IsMyMediasiteChannel":false,"IsPublishingCatalog":false,"DatabaseId":"4f476ef6-4c8a-407a-9d4c-37dfab838f63","SecurityId":"4f476ef6-4c8a-407a-9d4c-37dfab838f63"},"RssUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/rss/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/4f476ef64c8a407a9d4c37dfab838f6314/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","FriendlyUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/4f476ef64c8a407a9d4c37dfab838f6314/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","EditUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/edit/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","EmbedCode":"\u003ciframe width=\"1020\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/4f476ef64c8a407a9d4c37dfab838f6314/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/4f476ef64c8a407a9d4c37dfab838f6314/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-align:left\" \u003eView Full Screen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/small\u003e","Success":false,"Message":null,"LoginUrl":null,"ErrorDetails":null,"ValidationErrors":null}
