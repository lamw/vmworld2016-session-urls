To remain relevant, IT organizations need to embrace new technologies and adopt a holistic design approach. The good news is that it may not be as difficult as you think. VMware experts have been working hard to develop a comprehensive set of design guidelines and recommendations to help you architect a modern data center based on the VMware Software-Defined Data Center architecture. We cover both physical and logical design considerations across compute, storage and network, and equip you with the skills and knowledge you need to design, architect and implement a modern private cloud that will power your business, today, tomorrow, and well into the future.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"10:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 10:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 11:23:01","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"53 Minutes 1 Second ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/37a8b2574d60422f819369c3e65e60641d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/37a8b2574d60422f819369c3e65e60641d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/37a8b2574d60422f819369c3e65e60641d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/37a8b2574d60422f819369c3e65e60641d/af61cc9c-f98a-47fc-9a3b-4a00df746e37_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/37a8b2574d60422f819369c3e65e60641d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"d2fe4db1fb05410298969fe35377c79c2a","Name":"Kyle Gleed, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Kyle Gleed, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":997302882,"ParentResource":"37a8b257-4d60-422f-8193-69c3e65e6064"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":35},{"Id":"521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d","Name":"SDDC7780 - Agile: The Scrum Master for Your Software-Defined Data Center!","PresentationRootId":"521597a0-b58d-43e9-9ba9-40f5e484667d","Description":"You virtualized the SERVERS to reduce Capex and Opex in your data centers. You virtualized the STORAGE to make it inexpensive but remain high performance. You virtualized the NETWORK to make it simple yet secured. Guess what? You have embraced the power of a software-defined data center! While VMware allows you to build your infrastructure in the software tier, it is important that you quickly learn how to manage the lifecycle of this software-defined infrastructure and the services it has to offer. When the world of software development is moving towards agile frameworks, it only makes sense to leverage the same to help deploy, run, and scale your software-defined data center. Alongside lifecycle management of the various components of SDDC, Agile frameworks can also help IT build and deliver various services tailored to the requirements of business needs. This methodology of managing IT infrastructure as a piece of software code is no longer a distant dream. Concepts such as DevOps are clearly trying to deliver the missing development piece in the current operational structures of organizations. Frameworks like Agile with methodologies such as Scrum, DSDM, XP etc. make it possible for you to maximize your investments in SDDC.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:00 PM CDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 12:00:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 12:57:22","TimeZoneId":"19","DurationDisplay":"57 Minutes 22 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d/87933c47-8918-4844-8436-53b455292945_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/0e795e6393af48379bd32ee3972a903029/Presentation/521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d/27091db9-9764-4408-b72c-b85cca79e486.p2g.zip?attachmentName=SDDC7780+-+Agile%253a+The+Scrum+Master+for+Your+Softwa.p2g.zip\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8"},{"Name":"Video (Composite Video)","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/521597a0b58d43e99ba940f5e484667d1d/46b8727f-d781-4169-a6da-fd9270d1efdb.mp4?attachmentName=SDDC7780+-+Agile%253a+The+Scrum+Master+for+Your+Softwa.mp4\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":114,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"5e9fdad2068341bab94cdce479ac710d2a","Name":"Pritam Wadhwani, Johnson \u0026 Johnson","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Pritam Wadhwani, Johnson \u0026 Johnson","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-236628134,"ParentResource":"521597a0-b58d-43e9-9ba9-40f5e484667d"},{"Id":"aeaaebc4ba3742d3af4267eab332004d2a","Name":"Sunny Dua, VMware Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Sunny Dua, VMware Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":24283356,"ParentResource":"521597a0-b58d-43e9-9ba9-40f5e484667d"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":23},{"Id":"4c5b85e9b7da42029f7e96360094f7301d","Name":"SDDC8468R - A Beginner\u0027s Guide to the Software-Defined Data Center","PresentationRootId":"4c5b85e9-b7da-4202-9f7e-96360094f730","Description":"Welcome to the Software-Defined Data Center.

Think about all the elements from compute, storage, network and security, to automation and operations. There are a thousand ways to put those elements together to make something that works. But not all of them produce the best result for your business. What you need is a blueprint. Blueprints spell out exactly which elements you need, and the precise way to put them together to create the strongest, most highly available and resilient Software-Defined Data Center solution. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve established the VMware Validated Design, or VVD. We\u0027ve done the hard work of synthesizing the elements into a standardized, streamlined, system-level design that reduces deployment risk, decreases time-to-value and makes it easy to manage the day-to-day operations. In this session we will discuss and demonstrate fundamental constructs and design decisions of the VMware Validated Designs. From the physical to virtual infrastructure you\u0027ll gain a clear understanding of basis for all the designs and how it\u0027s used to rapidly and repeatedly deliver a ready-to-run Software-Defined Data Center.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 14:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 15:32:36","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 2 Minutes 36 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/9c673144384f46fc9ed592699ff844c01d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/9c673144384f46fc9ed592699ff844c01d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/9c673144384f46fc9ed592699ff844c01d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/9c673144384f46fc9ed592699ff844c01d/e8e00719-ab56-4add-8a04-f3b671d549ab_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/9c673144384f46fc9ed592699ff844c01d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"252a80ebff934394b7c01b4f4a8f61882a","Name":"Mike Brown, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Mike Brown, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-944088,"ParentResource":"9c673144-384f-46fc-9ed5-92699ff844c0"},{"Id":"cee050fcbfbc4a4a9b44a906137d4cbc2a","Name":"Ryan Johnson, VMware, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Ryan Johnson, VMware, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":91914772,"ParentResource":"9c673144-384f-46fc-9ed5-92699ff844c0"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":21},{"Id":"186d88dd7c674b2f87219b38298becef1d","Name":"SDDC7502 - On the Front Line: A VCDX Perspective Working in VMware Global Support Services","PresentationRootId":"186d88dd-7c67-4b2f-8721-9b38298becef","Description":"How many people get the opportunity to \u0026quot;walk a mile in their colleagues shoes\u0026quot;?

During this period, valuable insight and feedback were shared with customers and GSS, and valuable lessons were learned all around. The lessons learned during that month have been translated into discussions intended to help YOU our VMware customers. Their perspectives on what they observed from customers and the common themes of architectural design challenges were eye-opening. Come and hear from those VCDXs some of the most common issues they identified and the ways to mitigate.

You\u0027ll also learn the options and process to purchase and how to build a successful business case for Cloud Foundation.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 11:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 12:11:03","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"41 Minutes 3 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/ecbc2d43c1844c7bbd2ca8a3cb4487ca1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/ecbc2d43c1844c7bbd2ca8a3cb4487ca1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/ecbc2d43c1844c7bbd2ca8a3cb4487ca1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/ecbc2d43c1844c7bbd2ca8a3cb4487ca1d/0e86940b-3cf3-404d-bb5a-f27aa144c0fa_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/ecbc2d43c1844c7bbd2ca8a3cb4487ca1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"5bdad37ce2294bd5b1d0a332692847232a","Name":"Alan Hsia, VMWare","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Alan Hsia, VMWare","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":451624382,"ParentResource":"ecbc2d43-c184-4c7b-bd2c-a8a3cb4487ca"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":3},{"Id":"c28afa680b0a4440a4a7da41b3e59b2e1d","Name":"SDDC7692 - Tips for Realizing the Full Value of Your SDDC Transformation","PresentationRootId":"c28afa68-0b0a-4440-a4a7-da41b3e59b2e","Description":"As with any investment in IT innovation, the goal is to demonstrate measurable business value. In our deep experience assisting customers with their SDDC transformation, we\u0027ve found that there are two keys to success: 1. Establish and communicate value metrics early, then measure and report on them as your program progresses through its stages to keep everyone, including executives, engaged and committed to the long-term effort. 2. Realize that you cannot expect to manage the SDDC in the same way that you managed your legacy environment. Transforming the organization, people, and processes is essential to achieving the value you set out for. In this presentation, you will learn how to structure and manage your transformation program from the start in order to maximize success and value realization. If you are already on your journey, you will learn how to improve your existing program and fill the gaps that may be holding you back from a successful transformation and realizing value.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 11:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 12:20:02","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"50 Minutes 2 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c28afa680b0a4440a4a7da41b3e59b2e1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c28afa680b0a4440a4a7da41b3e59b2e1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/c28afa680b0a4440a4a7da41b3e59b2e1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c28afa680b0a4440a4a7da41b3e59b2e1d/b4c6034e-8f61-4ff5-92df-b3c84ddd55ba_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c28afa680b0a4440a4a7da41b3e59b2e1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"b40cd3ab1f1d45938bdba6841e7e96602a","Name":"Jose Alamo, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jose Alamo, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-2032511737,"ParentResource":"c28afa68-0b0a-4440-a4a7-da41b3e59b2e"},{"Id":"f748a73ea3db454fbe8e6254cdc3c6012a","Name":"Chris Kunselman, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Chris Kunselman, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":78458086,"ParentResource":"c28afa68-0b0a-4440-a4a7-da41b3e59b2e"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":5},{"Id":"89eb87848b704aa8bb01d185f32d341d1d","Name":"SDDC9726-SPO - Making SolidFire Invisible in your VMware Environment","PresentationRootId":"89eb8784-8b70-4aa8-bb01-d185f32d341d","Description":"IT organizations have moved from doing more with less to doing even more with less at a faster pace.

Modern attacks exploit this perimeter-only defense, hitching a ride with authorized users, then move laterally within the data center perimeter from workload to workload with little or no controls to block their propagation. Many of the recent public breaches have exemplified this \u0026ndash; starting with spear phishing or social engineering, leading to malware, vulnerability exploits, command and control, and unfettered lateral movement with in the data center until the attackers find what they are looking for \u0026ndash; which is then ex-filtrated or even held for ransom.

There is a 2X increase in data volume every 18 months and yet average data center utilizations are only at 50%. What explains this anomaly? Data centers are planned around peak usages but the actual usage is only a fraction of this. In addition, data centers are based on old inflexible architectures - which takes weeks or even months to provision and decommission. Enterprises and Cloud Service Providers are looking for ways to increase the agility and utilization of their fixed data center assets and drive down cost. Enter - Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) \u0026 Intel \u0026reg; Rack Scale Architecture (RSA). Intel Rack Scale Architecture provides the ability to logically disaggregate compute, storage and network resources and pool these resources for better resource utilization based on workload specific demands. Software Defined Data Center as realized through products like VMware Cloud Foundation enable IT to offer the private cloud experience for the enterprise. In this session we will cover innovations in the context of SDDC realized over Rack Scale Architecture. We will detail how a VMware offering like VMware Cloud Foundation and hardware management services (HMS) function can help with such a realization.

But the elimination of downtime, like the horizon, seems to recede as we progress toward it. One reason is that as our IT environments grow increasingly complex, the point products and tools we use to combat downtime have failed to keep pace. What needed is two-fold: 1) A practical evaluation model that enables IT professionals to understand tradeoffs between downtime and the prevention cost of downtime. 2) A continuity framework that enables IT professionals to prevent both homogeneous and heterogeneous downtime \u0026ndash; downtime both inside and outside of the SDDC (Software Defined Data Center.) An evaluation model will be reviewed that enables IT professionals to more readily measure and consider various aspects of downtime and costs. Using that model, we\u0026rsquo;ll do a deep dive into several potential continuity frameworks. These will include 1) A review of continuity frameworks in general. 2) A comparison of continuity frameworks to point products and tools. 3) Continuity frameworks that operate wholly inside of SDDC. 4) Continuity frameworks that operate both inside and outside of SDDC. 5) Continuity frameworks that enable protecting connected SDDC with tightly coupled clouds as well as with third-party hyperscale clouds. 6) Continuity frameworks that allow perimeter level security techniques to extend to data security against malicious attacks (e.g., Ransomware Trojans.) 7) Continuity frameworks that seamlessly enable modern VMware SDDCs to be protected with legacy bare metal clouds and physical hardware, operating systems, and applications","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 17:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 17:46:00","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"16 Minutes ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c3a95b64bae54570a8b116599e46198c1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c3a95b64bae54570a8b116599e46198c1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/c3a95b64bae54570a8b116599e46198c1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c3a95b64bae54570a8b116599e46198c1d/48743e12-3e6e-4a9d-b3ec-c8c16d0f9697_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c3a95b64bae54570a8b116599e46198c1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"024026335ad8474fa033a4c379860c7e2a","Name":"Mark Campbell, Unitrends","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Mark Campbell, Unitrends","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1867546190,"ParentResource":"c3a95b64-bae5-4570-a8b1-16599e46198c"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":1},{"Id":"baa4c4a97e6c4232aadb134bb10da5f71d","Name":"SDDC8520 - No IT Left Behind: Connecting the Software-Defined Data Center to Multi-Modal IT","PresentationRootId":"baa4c4a9-7e6c-4232-aadb-134bb10da5f7","Description":"As a developer of custom solutions for various public sector agencies, ISS has to be agile to remain competitive.

Instead, we chose to apply a DevOps model spanning our entire IT enterprise in an approach we call Multi-Modal IT. The ISS Multi-Modal IT resulted in a dynamic on-prem environment that supports flexible, timely and relevant capabilities while adhering to a wide range of compliance challenges. Virtualization alone was not sufficient to achieve the types of efficiencies, responsiveness and scale that was required. We needed to extend management to the process level.

Every system, host, switch, and storage system log and present data as each vendor deems fit. Different granularity of information, different time frames, and different output formats make it extremely difficult to correlate data and understand the dynamics of the virtual datacenter. Furthermore, new workloads introduce unique storage requirements, which inevitably require new technology. This not only impacts the design of your data center, it impacts the lifecycle of your IT investments. It\u0027s time to remove the boundaries of the different layers in the architecture and integrate different layers of caching, analytics, and storage array technology to drive higher consolidation ratios, reduce complexity, and increase the scale of your virtual datacenter. In this session, Andy Daniel, PernixData Principal Architect, and Bala Narasimhan, PernixData VP, Products will demonstrate how hyper-intelligence allows you to design, deploy, and operate and your next-generation storage platform.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 16:06:28","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"36 Minutes 28 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/a97056da24d0467f9c7d69fa8032cf451d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/a97056da24d0467f9c7d69fa8032cf451d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/a97056da24d0467f9c7d69fa8032cf451d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a97056da24d0467f9c7d69fa8032cf451d/59bfa8fc-be90-44c6-81d0-e200d2641391_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a97056da24d0467f9c7d69fa8032cf451d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"8a3a0269c9ef457ca2ceac1172b34ce42a","Name":"Bala Narasimhan, PernixData","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Bala Narasimhan, PernixData","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":419013676,"ParentResource":"a97056da-24d0-467f-9c7d-69fa8032cf45"},{"Id":"f49d29b292f7428d9cf31ec7ec5ae7e22a","Name":"Andy Daniel, PernixData","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Andy Daniel, PernixData","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1853493615,"ParentResource":"a97056da-24d0-467f-9c7d-69fa8032cf45"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," SDDC -

But that alone is not sufficient. You also have to ensure that you can operate such an environment effectively. This involves adjusting processes and bringing your people on board. Often the projects to implement a SDDC are dominated by technical aspects. Operational readiness is like an elephant in the room that nobody talks about. Often, you simply do not have the resources to take care of the latter. In this session we will explore how VMware Cloud Foundationsimplifies the technical aspects in such a dramatic way that you can free up project resources to plan for the operational aspects more thoroughly. We will also introduce the operational aspects tailored towards VMware Cloud Foundation.

As a result, SLAs are shrinking. IT is challenged to meet these SLAs, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough budget to provide services like disaster recovery (DR) using traditional methods and infrastructure. The good news is that the public cloud is becoming a viable infrastructure choice for DR with workload portability solutions that make cross-platform or cloud recovery possible. Platforms like VMware vCloud Air, AWS, and Azure provide the ability to bring DR to tier 2 and tier 3 workloads that have never been able to afford it before. In this session, we\u0026rsquo;ll first look at methods to leverage VM backup to cloud services like vCloud Air Object Storage, AWS S3, or Azure Blob storage for cost-effective disaster recovery. Then, we\u0026rsquo;ll examine ways to reduce costs by eliminating the significant expense of always-on cloud VMs (needed for replication and retention on many platforms) by leveraging these object storage services as on-demand DR repositories, and only spinning up compute resources when recovery is needed. Next, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore methods to protect workloads running *in* the cloud until failback to on-prem infrastructure can occur. Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at how similar processes can be used to streamline Dev/Test operations in the cloud.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 11:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 12:10:43","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"40 Minutes 43 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/7b75a8850556461ea9f3b85d7141b78d1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/7b75a8850556461ea9f3b85d7141b78d1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7b75a8850556461ea9f3b85d7141b78d1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7b75a8850556461ea9f3b85d7141b78d1d/5600d745-1fd9-4edb-931f-5c5019dba2d2_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/7b75a8850556461ea9f3b85d7141b78d1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/0e795e6393af48379bd32ee3972a903029/Presentation/7b75a8850556461ea9f3b85d7141b78d1d/01022e69-c8d4-4fd0-8287-5b8bdbae196e.p2g.zip?attachmentName=SDDC9404-SPO+-+Reinventing+Disaster+Recovery+Lever.p2g.zip\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"547750955b4643b88fddad23dc0e2aac2a","Name":"John Fox, Commvault","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"John Fox, Commvault","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-960121733,"ParentResource":"7b75a885-0556-461e-a9f3-b85d7141b78d"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":7},{"Id":"71f55b21db8e4a8489cb7f610da236fc1d","Name":"SDDC7616 - Strategizing Cloud Business Management Using vRealize Business","PresentationRootId":"71f55b21-db8e-4a84-89cb-7f610da236fc","Description":"The cloud model can facilitate the shift to a business focus for the entire IT hierarchy\u0026mdash;from the top to the technical teams managing and delivering the cloud. But to achieve the full business value of the cloud, companies need to put in place a more specialized and robust Cloud Business Management (CBM) practice. The CBM practice addresses the key business aspects of cloud operations. Whether your cloud is greenfield or an evolution of an existing environment, these business considerations are vital to achieving the expected agility and efficiency gains from the cloud model. Cloud business maturity models are used to baseline today\u0027s current state and envision tomorrow\u0027s desired state. Comprehensive cloud services definition and costing should be performed to solidify the service offerings and help understand its true unit costs. In addition, pricing strategies need to be established based on your organizations goals and cloud vision. This can be streamlined using VMware vRealize Business to drive a service consumption-based business model.

Business units can use their own virtual data center from the cloud: Bring Your Own Data Center (BYODC). They are increasingly turning to Amazon Web Services, Azure, vCloud Air, and other public cloud platforms to run their workloads. Most of the time this starts with development and test workloads, but increasingly occurs for production workloads as well. This causes challenges for the IT department regarding security, management, compliance, and costs. We will address the four common responses from IT departments to BYODC and how successful these responses are.","AirDateDisplay":"Sunday, August 28, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/28/2016 15:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/28/2016 15:21:46","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"21 Minutes 46 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/f132f5ab6e2b4cb691635b8224d4c26f1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/f132f5ab6e2b4cb691635b8224d4c26f1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f132f5ab6e2b4cb691635b8224d4c26f1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f132f5ab6e2b4cb691635b8224d4c26f1d/1b96c29d-e521-41b0-99e9-263d2ab45f0d_500_282.jpg?authTicket=a775ad8da63d4725904f1041d2333af8","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f132f5ab6e2b4cb691635b8224d4c26f1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Publish To Go","Url":null}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"65cfd36c-f89d-4b13-a42c-de5b89fd3bd7","Presenters":[{"Id":"b5ddc9f1cd204aa5a54e8f989c2765402a","Name":"Art de Blaauw, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Art de Blaauw, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":270816365,"ParentResource":"f132f5ab-6e2b-4cb6-9163-5b8224d4c26f"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"," Quick Talk"],"IsEditable":true,"IsPublishable":true,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":4},{"Id":"a729a1d2332b413b8e328511fe42eabe1d","Name":"SDDC7881-QT - Cloud Service Lifecycle in a DevOps-Focused Delivery Model","PresentationRootId":"a729a1d2-332b-413b-8e32-8511fe42eabe","Description":"The new Cloud Operations Group is about delivering agility, efficiency, and business value.
