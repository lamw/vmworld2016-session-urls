Drawing on detailed analysis and the experience of real building business cases for customers that only market leadership offers, we will show how Horizon 7 and Horizon Air Hybrid Mode represent the new state of the art in desktop cost leadership.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 16:16:34","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"46 Minutes 34 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/713fc4f02dc3461c84a56a1bf258ef281d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/713fc4f02dc3461c84a56a1bf258ef281d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/713fc4f02dc3461c84a56a1bf258ef281d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/713fc4f02dc3461c84a56a1bf258ef281d/a8a21144-3887-4dac-bdf9-d76f7bb9109e_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/713fc4f02dc3461c84a56a1bf258ef281d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"2a7f5eff-a3ef-4539-b50e-b676dbfb2cbd","Presenters":[{"Id":"5b6c813a1ffc4d73bc46811f9861abd42a","Name":"Brian Gammage, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Brian Gammage, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1018510237,"ParentResource":"713fc4f0-2dc3-461c-84a5-6a1bf258ef28"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Virtual App and Desktop Delivery","End-User Computing"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":5},{"Id":"02ced6ba197a400cbc3ac9704aa65ffa1d","Name":"EUC8725 - Everything You Need to Know About Horizon Remote Desktop Services Hosted Applications (But Probably Do Not)","PresentationRootId":"02ced6ba-197a-400c-bc3a-c9704aa65ffa","Description":"Since their introduction in VMware Horizon 6, remote desktop services hosted applications have been a cornerstone capability for delivering desktops and applications of every type from a single unified platform.

They have gone from being a tool that supports a user menial tasks, to a personal resource that houses information shared with colleagues, friends and family. In many cases, enterprises have lost the ability to manage individual desktops and need to regain control before the worst happens. VMware Business Mobility and Enterprise Desktop products are designed to help organizations take back their desktops in a way that provides minimal impact on the end-user and maximum peace of mind for the organization. VMware training equips users at all levels with the skills and knowledge needed to deploy and manage these solutions. In this session, we will highlight the main features of the products including Horizon, AppsVolumes and AirWatch. We will help you understand how each fits into the organization. We\u0026rsquo;ll also include an overview of available training and certification programs that ensure the IT staff is trained and ready to take full advantage of mobility tools.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 14:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 14:44:26","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"44 Minutes 26 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/b8b64f6e4ac747af8e453f612c53000d1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/b8b64f6e4ac747af8e453f612c53000d1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/b8b64f6e4ac747af8e453f612c53000d1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b8b64f6e4ac747af8e453f612c53000d1d/adc84d48-fb59-439e-9aca-35feb29bdf83_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b8b64f6e4ac747af8e453f612c53000d1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"2a7f5eff-a3ef-4539-b50e-b676dbfb2cbd","Presenters":[{"Id":"5a8363f1b6554773bd8cb61f6fa072d12a","Name":"Linus Bourque, VMware, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Linus Bourque, VMware, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":146617238,"ParentResource":"b8b64f6e-4ac7-47af-8e45-3f612c53000d"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Virtual App and Desktop Delivery","End-User Computing"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":9},{"Id":"c0528977d4064f32affac00175cd1fc81d","Name":"EUC8346 - Modernizing and Mobilizing Retail IT","PresentationRootId":"c0528977-d406-4f32-affa-c00175cd1fc8","Description":"Learn how The Secure Digital Workspace for Retail turns shoppers into buyers, transforms workflows and improves the retail experience across any computing environment, integrating identity, application, and enterprise mobility management to deliver a secure, unified workspace available at all times.

Organizations are actively looking to implement digital workspaces: the ability to allow end users a simple way to access all their corporate data and applications from any device in a secure way. Virtual desktops and applications play a big role in enabling this transformation, but remain complex and costly to deploy. VMware Horizon Air hybrid mode changes this by addressing the speed and ease with which IT administrators can deploy virtual desktops and applications while providing cost- and performance-optimized infrastructure for workloads that are deployed on the premises, in the cloud, or hybrid. We will take a look at how Horizon Air hybrid mode integrates virtual desktop, application, and other associated technologies; provides a unified, cloud-based management console; and offers a hybrid deployment model combining software-as-a-service (SaaS) benefits with on-premises benefits of compliance and performance. We will look at the technology components, explore sample use cases, take a sneak peek at the product, and discuss the technical details of the solution.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:00 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 11:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 12:00:18","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 18 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c7cb52beec3c4eacbb4a6a5d6455811a1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c7cb52beec3c4eacbb4a6a5d6455811a1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/c7cb52beec3c4eacbb4a6a5d6455811a1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c7cb52beec3c4eacbb4a6a5d6455811a1d/448a4c09-b06a-44ad-b28c-e3807cdf6044_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c7cb52beec3c4eacbb4a6a5d6455811a1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"2a7f5eff-a3ef-4539-b50e-b676dbfb2cbd","Presenters":[{"Id":"3d1fedf5d61449a0affd293e37bc17fe2a","Name":"Ken Ringdahl, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Ken Ringdahl, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":922211758,"ParentResource":"c7cb52be-ec3c-4eac-bb4a-6a5d6455811a"},{"Id":"ce8eac622fcb41fcb31d770c339807142a","Name":"Shikha Mittal, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Shikha Mittal, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-886734142,"ParentResource":"c7cb52be-ec3c-4eac-bb4a-6a5d6455811a"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Breakout Session"," Virtual App and Desktop Delivery","End-User Computing"," Technical – Introductory"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":9},{"Id":"8c219543f43c4f0fa96f8d0fcc5f74d01d","Name":"EUC8345 - Mobilizing and Modernizing Government IT to Advance Missions: The Secure Digital Workspace for Government","PresentationRootId":"8c219543-f43c-4f0f-a96f-8d0fcc5f74d0","Description":"The widespread consumerization of mobile devices continues to have sweeping effects on today\u0027s work environment as productivity is no longer confined to on-premises devices and networks. As a result, organizations within both the private and public sectors are enabling mobile access to enterprise resources to not only improve employee productivity but also strengthen data security and streamline IT management. This new way of working\u0026mdash;labeled the digital workspace\u0026mdash;is beginning to creep into government workplaces. The digital workspace is revolutionizing citizen service delivery and mission outcomes when successfully deployed. At its core, the digital workspace for government is an end-user computing model that requires desktop and application virtualization as a means to enable anytime, anywhere access to government resources.

This vision is quickly becoming a reality. However, medical and IoT devices used for monitoring are creating new security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed from evolving threats. One of these threats, ransomware, has affected over 50% of all hospitals in the United States. Although the amount of money demanded in these attacks has been small, the resulting costs from system downtime have been astronomical. IoT and medical devices are well known to be vulnerable, and most manufacturers have not yet included robust security features in their design. Forrester Research has predicted that this year the healthcare industry will see a ransomware attack specifically from a medical device or wearable IoT device. Every medical device has an IT component, and almost all handle or store data. IoT devices are constantly feeding back data and information. These devices need to be managed, tracked, and updated on a regular basis. A large healthcare system can have well over 60 to 80 thousand of these devices ranging from beds, infusion pumps, and vital monitors to new web-enabled devices such as wearables or implantables.

One of the world largest health insurance company choose Virtual SAN as the software defined storage solution for their virtual desktop environment. Their environment consists of over 22,000 virtual desktops and over 1000 server virtual machines on 1.7 PB of storage capacity. The drivers for selecting Virtual SAN was improve operational efficiencies by leveraging Virtual SAN storage policy based management and increased end-user performance. A large North East Regional Bank is utilizing vSphere and Virtual SAN to meet their high availability needs to support their production environment. Removing vCenter and other third party management components from their production environment and onto a VSAN enabled vSphere management cluster, these critical tools are available for use if there is a production outage. VSAN delivers the shared storage capacity and performance that these demanding workloads require. This use case leverages the latest vSphere and VSAN 6.2 release to take advantage of all-flash, deduplication, compression, and the inherited redundancy. Additional redundancy within the datacenter is achieved by segregating the vSphere Cluster by fault domains. A global manufacturing company selected Virtual SAN as the Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) storage solution for 1000+ remote offices. Additionally, their most recent implementation using VSAN enabled vSphere clusters in two larger distribution centers and leverage vSphere replication for bi-directional asynchronous replication to protect VSAN data at each location. A global financial services firm uses Virtual SAN enabled vSphere clusters for their Business Critical Applications. In addition, they deployed Horizon View on Virtual SAN to achieve low cost, high performance, and linear scalability of compute, memory, and storage resources for Virtual Desktop.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 17:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 18:05:13","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 5 Minutes 13 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/577dcdfeb0de40f0aee4f76750372d7d1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/577dcdfeb0de40f0aee4f76750372d7d1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/577dcdfeb0de40f0aee4f76750372d7d1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/577dcdfeb0de40f0aee4f76750372d7d1d/4c799e14-e114-425b-9171-e67dc0329e46_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/577dcdfeb0de40f0aee4f76750372d7d1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"2a7f5eff-a3ef-4539-b50e-b676dbfb2cbd","Presenters":[{"Id":"d0d13f9da545423abb9127b5c34ec44d2a","Name":"Frank Gesino, vmware, Moderator","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Frank Gesino, vmware, Moderator","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":957229730,"ParentResource":"577dcdfe-b0de-40f0-aee4-f76750372d7d"},{"Id":"def5e2f4fd4043e8bffe5792c14c67432a","Name":",","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":",","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1037749148,"ParentResource":"577dcdfe-b0de-40f0-aee4-f76750372d7d"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Panel Discussion"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":23},{"Id":"860c2cc304b4480386c06d24f26705581d","Name":"STO8754 - Virtual SAN and Horizon: Designed for Simple, Powerful Virtual Desktops","PresentationRootId":"860c2cc3-04b4-4803-86c0-6d24f2670558","Description":"The \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; view of virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is fading as the data center converges and end-user computing diverges.

But organizations are looking for smarter solutions that are easier to deploy, are cost effective, and allow flexibility of deployment. What is desired is an approach that brings the benefits of the cloud, such as software as a service (SaaS), coupled with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) for ease of infrastructure management. VMware Horizon Air hybrid mode does just that by delivering a hybrid cloud software service hosted by VMware, which enables organizations to deliver virtual desktops and manage applications from on-premises infrastructure, while centrally managing it all from the cloud. The advantage of this solution is that the desktop capacity resides in the customers\u0027 data center (similar to Horizon 7), but all of the administration will be done from the cloud (like Horizon Air). This merges the best of both, the cloud and on the premises, and enables customers to take advantage of a cloud-based SaaS experience without worrying about network connectivity or data compliance. We will take a closer look at the product architecture, see the product setup and deployment in action, and explore how the service can be used by organizations for typical use cases.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 14:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 15:19:45","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"49 Minutes 45 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/f8060f42594c47f09bc3cd48f21ab6c21d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/f8060f42594c47f09bc3cd48f21ab6c21d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/f8060f42594c47f09bc3cd48f21ab6c21d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f8060f42594c47f09bc3cd48f21ab6c21d/e15768b8-bd28-4c2e-a5c5-f1f0daef164f_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f8060f42594c47f09bc3cd48f21ab6c21d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Video (Composite Video)","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f8060f42594c47f09bc3cd48f21ab6c21d/271a0759-3fa8-4e86-b4b6-ce3a057fc912.mp4?attachmentName=EUC9217+-+On-Premises+Workloads+with+Cloud-Based+M.mp4\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":97,"FolderId":"2a7f5eff-a3ef-4539-b50e-b676dbfb2cbd","Presenters":[{"Id":"838854913b994f8cb3d0e13d86488b322a","Name":"Shikha Mittal, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Shikha Mittal, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-886734142,"ParentResource":"f8060f42-594c-47f0-9bc3-cd48f21ab6c2"},{"Id":"03c57948d49d41028fe3e69caecb28f22a","Name":"Simon Le Comte, VMWare","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Simon Le Comte, VMWare","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":259830045,"ParentResource":"f8060f42-594c-47f0-9bc3-cd48f21ab6c2"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Virtual App and Desktop Delivery","End-User Computing"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":4},{"Id":"c81656bda92a4de3b5cd551d6d7ee0ff1d","Name":"STO7443r - How did VMware IT Achieve a Non-Disruptive Disaster Recovery Test in 90 Minutes for 900 Terabytes of Storage and 2000 Production Virtual Machines?","PresentationRootId":"c81656bd-a92a-4de3-b5cd-551d6d7ee0ff","Description":"VMware IT team achieved a non-disruptive disaster recovery (DR) test failover for 900 terabytes of storage and over 2000 production virtual machines in 90 minutes using VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM), VMware NSX and VMware Horizon View. Simplified DR is one of the biggest driving factors for virtualizing multi-tier applications. Most enterprises have struggled to meet business DR requirements due to the cost, effort and down time involved in implementation and testing. VMware IT team developed a DR approach with the goals of shortening the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and allowing non-disruptive DR testing that includes application functionality validation. We will discuss the architecture of VMware IT non-disruptive DR solution using SRM, how VMware NSX can be used to create an isolated copy of the production network topology for DR testing and the implementation of VMware View for end-user connectivity to the isolated DR test network. This session will also discuss the testing methodology and advanced configurations used to achieve the DR testing with a shortened RTO.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"2:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 14:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 14:55:12","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"55 Minutes 12 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c81656bda92a4de3b5cd551d6d7ee0ff1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c81656bda92a4de3b5cd551d6d7ee0ff1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/c81656bda92a4de3b5cd551d6d7ee0ff1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c81656bda92a4de3b5cd551d6d7ee0ff1d/4551be3e-f17c-463b-b458-b39dd434accb_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c81656bda92a4de3b5cd551d6d7ee0ff1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"2a7f5eff-a3ef-4539-b50e-b676dbfb2cbd","Presenters":[{"Id":"aa8456d846e14406bc3e7c4a572b997f2a","Name":"Mohammed Raffic Kajamoideen, VMware Software India Ltd","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Mohammed Raffic Kajamoideen, VMware Software India Ltd","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1625246540,"ParentResource":"c81656bd-a92a-4de3-b5cd-551d6d7ee0ff"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":8},{"Id":"087bb3f92cd243419cbaff30381e76f21d","Name":"EUC9160 - Secure Digital Workspace of the Future: Embracing the Opportunities Presented by Enterprise Mobility in Financial Services","PresentationRootId":"087bb3f9-2cd2-4341-9cba-ff30381e76f2","Description":"In recent years, there has been a shift in the way financial institutions operate.

Simplified DR is one of the biggest driving factors for virtualizing multi-tier applications. Most enterprises have struggled to meet business DR requirements due to the cost, effort and down time involved in implementation and testing. VMware IT team developed a DR approach with the goals of shortening the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and allowing non-disruptive DR testing that includes application functionality validation. We will discuss the architecture of VMware IT non-disruptive DR solution using SRM, how VMware NSX can be used to create an isolated copy of the production network topology for DR testing and the implementation of VMware View for end-user connectivity to the isolated DR test network. This session will also discuss the testing methodology and advanced configurations used to achieve the DR testing with a shortened RTO.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:00 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 11:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 11:44:15","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"44 Minutes 15 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c70d29e2db834d5c83ba5a5cd39f4cb01d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c70d29e2db834d5c83ba5a5cd39f4cb01d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c70d29e2db834d5c83ba5a5cd39f4cb01d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c70d29e2db834d5c83ba5a5cd39f4cb01d/47d5c131-90b7-4bd9-97dd-8012352b1f77_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c70d29e2db834d5c83ba5a5cd39f4cb01d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"2a7f5eff-a3ef-4539-b50e-b676dbfb2cbd","Presenters":[{"Id":"590df4ff00f24b68a0f3454374349f4b2a","Name":"Mohammed Raffic Kajamoideen, VMware Software India Ltd","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Mohammed Raffic Kajamoideen, VMware Software India Ltd","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1625246540,"ParentResource":"c70d29e2-db83-4d5c-83ba-5a5cd39f4cb0"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Hyper-Converged Infrastructure and Storage"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":149},{"Id":"7675fd8f1b4c42ceb958348e43e991621d","Name":"EUC9387 - Deployment Best Practices for VMware Identity Manager","PresentationRootId":"7675fd8f-1b4c-42ce-b958-348e43e99162","Description":"VMware Workspace ONE combines identity and mobility management to provide frictionless and secure access to all the apps and data employees need to work, wherever, whenever and from whatever device they choose.
