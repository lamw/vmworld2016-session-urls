Although the front-end services were hosted on a VMware virtualization platform, the back-end Oracle database resided on a physical Solaris environment. In addition, 12 supporting application services needed to be integrated into the overall Banner architecture, hosted on a mixture of virtual and physical environments (approximately 30 servers). Using the VMware vCloud Air suite of services, St. John\u0027s was able to build and test a DR solution in approximately 10 weeks. Virtual infrastructure was set to replicate on a 4-hour interval to the DRaaS environment. This environment was connected to a set of physical servers located in the vCloud Air Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Using Rackware technology, physical Windows servers were replicated within a similar timeframe from the St. John\u0027s on-premises environment to the vCloud environment. Load balancing and domain services were built directly within the VPC to support the initiative. The Oracle database was replicated across through a series of Rsync scripts from the Solaris platform to a Linux environment within the VPC twice daily, providing a RPO of 12 hours.
