But if you are going to have code (e.g. vRealize Automation blueprints, vSphere templates, vRealize Orchestrator workflows, etc.) describe your infrastructure, you will need to manage these artifacts the same way that developers manage the lifecycle of their applications. This session will help IT administrators and cloud architects understand how they can adopt DevOps best practices to help them manage their private and public cloud infrastructure artifacts. We\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Fannie Mae is leveraging vRealize Code Stream and the pre-built vRealize Code Stream Management Pack for IT DevOps (also known as \u0026ldquo;Houdini\u0026rdquo;) to move to an Infrastructure as Code operational model for vRealize Automation blueprints and vRealize Orchestrator workflows. We\u0026rsquo;ll also explain and demonstrate how this solution helps vSphere, vRealize Operations and NSX administrators manage the lifecycle of software defined infrastructure across Dev, Test and Production environments. Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate the latest improvements, including integration with popular source code management systems.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 11:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 12:28:07","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"58 Minutes 7 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/33c11dc821a549799ce0d0019ac2256e1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/33c11dc821a549799ce0d0019ac2256e1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/33c11dc821a549799ce0d0019ac2256e1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/33c11dc821a549799ce0d0019ac2256e1d/187fa42a-8b82-478a-8641-89417d12a561_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/33c11dc821a549799ce0d0019ac2256e1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"492e00d8-7159-4b61-88ea-a58285ef524c","Presenters":[{"Id":"9273ea99cce4458fbe5832d30f61109a2a","Name":"Tom O\u0027Rourke, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Tom O\u0027Rourke, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-721937,"ParentResource":"33c11dc8-21a5-4979-9ce0-d0019ac2256e"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Cloud Management","Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":12},{"Id":"2420f4c0e669480c9aeb22bb4ac3c0ec1d","Name":"DEVOP9093 - Unpanel: How I Survived the DevOps Transition","PresentationRootId":"2420f4c0-e669-480c-9aeb-22bb4ac3c0ec","Description":"Join this interactive panel discussion with Reg Lo and Ed Hoppitt as they moderate a lively exchange between IT practitioners and their development counterparts.

Infrastructure in itself does not add direct value to a business. Although it is essential that you deliver infrastructure quickly, its value lies in helping deploy applications more quickly, building services around those applications, and drastically increasing time to market. A true platform as a service (PaaS) and DevOps framework will help your developers deliver software quickly and efficiently, but all of this hinges on putting together a clear strategy across technology, people, and process. In this session, get practical advice for creating a roadmap that incorporates the tools, process, and framework that will provide the most value.

The rise of cloud computing now gives companies the ability to run applications in their own datacenter or run applications by using the services of cloud providers. But what if you could run an application hybrid across your own datacenters and that of a cloud provider; the best of both worlds combined!? Many organizations today run their own datacenters. That means that all applications and their data is stored within VMware and the underlying infrastructure. But what we now see is that companies are looking toward cloud providers to consume certain services as they are cheaper, more scalable or faster than what they can within their own datacenters. Google over the years has built an excellent infrastructure to host its own services such as GMail, Youtube and Apps. The underlying infrastructure services are now made available to end-users through Google Cloud Platform. In this session we\u0026rsquo;ll explain how you can extend you existing and new applications with VMware and Google Cloud Platform services. We will show you how to run an application across both cloud platforms. This way you can use your existing applications and data while leveraging the capabilities that both VMware and Google Cloud Platform have to offer. VMware and Google. The best of both worlds.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"4:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 16:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 16:55:11","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"55 Minutes 11 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/f1608b708d36441d83e1362bcff8209f1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/f1608b708d36441d83e1362bcff8209f1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/f1608b708d36441d83e1362bcff8209f1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f1608b708d36441d83e1362bcff8209f1d/e260f40a-dbce-44a5-95f8-010f8342e0a2_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/f1608b708d36441d83e1362bcff8209f1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"492e00d8-7159-4b61-88ea-a58285ef524c","Presenters":[{"Id":"11d70bcbb43b4b9b916be1ba136c31092a","Name":"Jay Marshall, Google","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jay Marshall, Google","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":145848381,"ParentResource":"f1608b70-8d36-441d-83e1-362bcff8209f"},{"Id":"2fe7cb1dda51403f94591010395da66a2a","Name":"Martijn Baecke, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Martijn Baecke, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2057261812,"ParentResource":"f1608b70-8d36-441d-83e1-362bcff8209f"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session","DevOps"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":6},{"Id":"12396f9d2a9f478696848c947b6e89191d","Name":"MGT8831 - Digital Transformation Through VMware DevOps Code Stream","PresentationRootId":"12396f9d-2a9f-4786-9684-8c947b6e8919","Description":"\u0026Eacute;lectricit\u0026eacute; de France S.A.

VMW solved this problem by implementing VMware Managed Public Key Infrastructure Service (mPKI) which is scalable and provides high availability, redundant infrastructure with back up and disaster recovery features. VMware mPKI supports the full PKI lifecycle and key management including: enrollment, revocation, renewal and recovery procedures. For mobile devices, integration of mPKI with AirWatch provides a secure mechanism to install, revoke and renew certificates automatically, a seamless sign-on experience, the ability for executives to securely view bookings data. The workflow within AirWatch handles security risks associated with disabled active directory (AD) accounts, stolen or lost devices, an employee leaving the company and other scenarios when keys can be compromised. The AirWatch self-service portal also helps users to self manage their devices. The advantages of VMware mPKI includes using a dedicated private two tier hierarchy Certificate Authority (CA) environment. This environment is being used to issue certificates to managed VMware devices by providing VMware with the necessary keys and certificate controls. VMware Workspace ONE with Mobile Single Sign-On (SSO) was integrated with mPKI to provide a seamless single sign on experience to employees on AirWatch-enrolled devices. VMware wireless environment was integrated with mPKI to provide more secure access to employees without the need for a virtual private network (VPN) on VMware managed devices. By integrating mPKI with Palo Alto Network Global Protect VPN authentication access is now based on certificates and AD credentials.","AirDateDisplay":"Sunday, August 28, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:00 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/28/2016 11:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/28/2016 11:29:03","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"29 Minutes 3 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/48abb43f96914e39b2e293dad1a7ce941d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/48abb43f96914e39b2e293dad1a7ce941d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/48abb43f96914e39b2e293dad1a7ce941d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/48abb43f96914e39b2e293dad1a7ce941d/6497f88a-06ca-4abd-90bd-10de8a2614cb_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/48abb43f96914e39b2e293dad1a7ce941d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"492e00d8-7159-4b61-88ea-a58285ef524c","Presenters":[{"Id":"38f491fdeda94ee3bc75b4f71f32d3252a","Name":"John Drummond, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"John Drummond, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-910835875,"ParentResource":"48abb43f-9691-4e39-b2e2-93dad1a7ce94"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session","DevOps"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":4}],"CurrentFolder":{"Id":"a4b8d12d-cea7-4165-abb5-8e1994e88a28","ParentCatalogFolderId":"ccf3adb0-c156-4815-bb02-90195c0edccc","CatalogId":"dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40","DynamicFolderId":"492e00d8-7159-4b61-88ea-a58285ef524c","DynamicFolderName":null,"RootDynamicFolderId":"dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40","Name":"DevOps","Description":"","Type":3,"DisplayOptions":13,"Shortcut":null,"IsReadOnly":true,"Owner":"bruceh","IsStaticFolder":false,"IsDynamicFolder":false,"IsVirtualFolder":true,"IncludeSubFolders":true,"IsSearchBased":false,"LimitSearchToCatalog":true,"MyMediasiteChannel":false,"CanPublishTo":false,"IsSearchBasedCatalog":false,"IsMyMediasiteChannel":false,"IsPublishingCatalog":false,"DatabaseId":"492e00d8-7159-4b61-88ea-a58285ef524c","SecurityId":"492e00d8-7159-4b61-88ea-a58285ef524c"},"RssUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/rss/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/492e00d871594b6188eaa58285ef524c14/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","FriendlyUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/492e00d871594b6188eaa58285ef524c14/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","EditUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/edit/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","EmbedCode":"\u003ciframe width=\"1020\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/492e00d871594b6188eaa58285ef524c14/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/492e00d871594b6188eaa58285ef524c14/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-align:left\" \u003eView Full Screen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/small\u003e","Success":false,"Message":null,"LoginUrl":null,"ErrorDetails":null,"ValidationErrors":null}
