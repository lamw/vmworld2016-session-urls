The overall concept to getting software to work in the cloud requires a broad set of components that work together. This could include architecting to support microservices, containers, as well as integration with existing backend systems. This session will provide a deep dive into VMware Cloud Native products that will assist in those components functioning as a well-oiled machine and provide an overview on how this is done and why it is important to your business. Find out how to empower your developers so they will be able to run and deploy apps on the cloud quickly and easily without requiring significant resources from IT Operations, while keeping everything up and running without compromising security and compliance. The products that will bridge the gap from today to tomorrow are Photon Platform \u0026 vSphere Integrated Containers. Photon Platform provides direct support for cloud-native workloads with its scale out architecture, automation API, and capabilities for container centric workloads. We\u0027re eager to hear feedback and suggestions to help shape the future of Photon Platform. Additionally, Sphere Integrated Containers (VIC) will be discussed which allows for container workloads within customers\u0026rsquo; existing vCenter deployments. Join us and learn how you can bridge these two worlds by allowing developers to instantiate cloud-native workloads while allowing IT ops to leverage their existing skills, knowledge, and processes to run and maintain containers in production.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 11:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 12:12:33","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"42 Minutes 33 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/882a63e012454aa1b3b03eea6bd0f3e81d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/882a63e012454aa1b3b03eea6bd0f3e81d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/882a63e012454aa1b3b03eea6bd0f3e81d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/882a63e012454aa1b3b03eea6bd0f3e81d/4f4a417d-58f7-4cf3-9081-5eca9b80a4ff_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/882a63e012454aa1b3b03eea6bd0f3e81d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"df276edf-3221-4ef0-bca7-0c06394cb1d6","Presenters":[{"Id":"0cabc88048fb45fa93d868a48dbdd6aa2a","Name":"Paul Fazzone, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Paul Fazzone, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":295439733,"ParentResource":"882a63e0-1245-4aa1-b3b0-3eea6bd0f3e8"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["End-User Computing"," Technical – Introductory"," Spotlight Session"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":33},{"Id":"99c9274aa88440099d926070fb3cfced1d","Name":"VIRT8612-S - How Travis Credit Union Virtualized Their Systems and Significantly Improved Stability and Performance","PresentationRootId":"99c9274a-a884-4009-9d92-6070fb3cfced","Description":"In this case study discussion, we will describe the successful implementation of a fully virtualized, highly available Oracle RAC environment. Presenters will share how Travis Credit Union (TCU) consolidated and streamlined their systems and processes and saw a significant improvement in both stability and performance. Travis Credit Union, one of the United State\u0027s largest credit unions, has been successfully serving its members since 1951. Travis Credit Union, which serves almost 200,000 members worldwide, has assets totaling more $2.5 billion. With 23 branches in Northern California, they also provide worldwide access to over 800,000 ATMs, in addition to their online banking and mobile applications. With an emphasis on delivering the best customer service and suite of financial services to their members, Travis Credit Union needed to modernize its infrastructure and applications. So Travis Credit Union partnered with House of Brick Technologies to develop a reference architecture that would position the company to leverage an existing investment in virtualization, with a focus on reliability and scalability. Travis Credit Union decided on a suite of powerful applications to meet its needs: Oracle RAC on VMware (vSphere), EMC storage, and VMware Site Recovery Manager for disaster preparedness. With the new platform in place, Travis Credit Union now has a stable, high performing, flexible platform from which to manage and provide member services. This positions Travis Credit Union for growth and an enhanced member experience today and for years to come. Join us as we review lessons learned from the design phase, the implementation phase, and failover testing.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 17:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 17:51:52","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"51 Minutes 52 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/99c9274aa88440099d926070fb3cfced1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/99c9274aa88440099d926070fb3cfced1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/99c9274aa88440099d926070fb3cfced1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/99c9274aa88440099d926070fb3cfced1d/8311e521-72c4-461a-8143-917338fe7575_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/99c9274aa88440099d926070fb3cfced1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"df276edf-3221-4ef0-bca7-0c06394cb1d6","Presenters":[{"Id":"eac87509467f43c3a33700169f863f3d2a","Name":"Jim Hannan, House of Brick","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jim Hannan, House of Brick","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1101990276,"ParentResource":"99c9274a-a884-4009-9d92-6070fb3cfced"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Virtualizing Applications"," Spotlight Session"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":7},{"Id":"a7f598b7cb0641eabb99ff7ab26fad341d","Name":"SDDC8618-S - Introducing VMware Cloud Foundation","PresentationRootId":"a7f598b7-cb06-41ea-bb99-ff7ab26fad34","Description":"To respond to the ever increasing demand for faster innovation, organizations are looking to shift to a more agile, service-oriented IT model that leverages both private and public clouds.

In this session, we will provide an overview of VMware Cloud Foundation and showcase how customers can leverage it both on and off prem demoing key features.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"4:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 16:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 17:01:32","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 1 Minute 32 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/a7f598b7cb0641eabb99ff7ab26fad341d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/a7f598b7cb0641eabb99ff7ab26fad341d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/a7f598b7cb0641eabb99ff7ab26fad341d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a7f598b7cb0641eabb99ff7ab26fad341d/72576215-8d60-4fb0-a5d8-6ca44a492ccd_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a7f598b7cb0641eabb99ff7ab26fad341d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"df276edf-3221-4ef0-bca7-0c06394cb1d6","Presenters":[{"Id":"124c52be72ca4b8bbbed2463c4408c1d2a","Name":"Alberto Farronato, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Alberto Farronato, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1392767056,"ParentResource":"a7f598b7-cb06-41ea-bb99-ff7ab26fad34"},{"Id":"cb58a55c46944ba8a0663d9694c5471b2a","Name":"Krish Sivakumar, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Krish Sivakumar, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-569056308,"ParentResource":"a7f598b7-cb06-41ea-bb99-ff7ab26fad34"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Introductory"," SDDC - Plan, Build and Operate"," Spotlight Session"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":76},{"Id":"95d689c2ecfc4e11bb199bca1ab61f811d","Name":"SEC9990-S - How Virtualization Will Transform Security","PresentationRootId":"95d689c2-ecfc-4e11-bb19-9bca1ab61f81","Description":"Take a look at the future of software-defined security\nSecurity spend has been growing twice as fast as IT spend. It would seem the only thing growing faster than security spend\u0026hellip; is security losses. This spiraling trend shows no evidence of turning around despite massive investment and innovation in security technology. At the heart of the issue is an architectural gap - between the applications and data we are trying to protect, and the infrastructure from which we are trying to protect them. Virtualization could be the key to solving this problem \u0026mdash; enabling security to be architected-in, rather than bolted on. Micro-segmentation has opened the door for a wave of innovation \u0026mdash; enabling us to see and control the infrastructure through the lens of the application. But this is only the beginning. In this session we will discuss the state of the art \u0026mdash; as well as the future of security \u0026mdash; through virtualization. We will discuss how organizations are transforming the security strategy today, and we will demonstrate some new technology directions, that extend \u0026quot;least privilege\u0026quot; policy from the network, to compute and data, and from the private cloud, to the public cloud and next gen apps. Get a glimpse of the future; a more secure future - through virtualization.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 16:31:46","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 1 Minute 46 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/95d689c2ecfc4e11bb199bca1ab61f811d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/95d689c2ecfc4e11bb199bca1ab61f811d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/95d689c2ecfc4e11bb199bca1ab61f811d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/95d689c2ecfc4e11bb199bca1ab61f811d/0447fe3f-9bdf-4d43-98ba-a434aa2f40ad_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/95d689c2ecfc4e11bb199bca1ab61f811d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"df276edf-3221-4ef0-bca7-0c06394cb1d6","Presenters":[{"Id":"cd01bbc48a76467a96a13c15a477427d2a","Name":"Tom Corn, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Tom Corn, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1390290559,"ParentResource":"95d689c2-ecfc-4e11-bb19-9bca1ab61f81"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Cloud Infrastructure"," Spotlight Session"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":49},{"Id":"4019befeb25f44659e4fc3540664329f1d","Name":"NET9989-S - NSX - The Network Bridge to the Multi-cloud Future","PresentationRootId":"9543eace-b29b-465f-84e0-b4c07b25fc63","Description":"Networking is undergoing fundamental change to support tomorrow application infrastructures, hosted across hypervisors and living partly on-premise and partly across multiple public clouds, joining both traditional and third platform architectures.
