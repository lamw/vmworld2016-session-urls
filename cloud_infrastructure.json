In healthcare IT, downtime doesn\u0027t just mean lost dollars or lost productivity. It can mean lost lives and grieving families. As vSphere versions get out of date or approach the end of support, keeping old infrastructure running just gets more difficult. HCA is the largest for-profit healthcare management corporation in the country. Its vSphere environment consists of around 1,000 hosts and 25,000 virtual machines. Until Q1 2016, HCA had been running vSphere 5.0 as a standard. With the end of support for 5.0 coming in August, that operating standard was no longer an option. With zero tolerance for downtime at this scale, it was vital that a simple but thorough process be developed to upgrade HCA\u0027s vSphere environment to 6.0. This session will discuss the challenges HCA faced with their scale and the looming end of support date for vSphere 5.0. Also, we will spend time identifying and explaining the process methodologies that were developed to ensure an upgrade path with no unplanned downtime. Beyond having the vSphere infrastructure upgraded, aligned, and consistent, there were greater benefits realized from this project, including fundamental changes in the view of lifecycle management in the vSphere environment. We will also explore how multiple, quantized standards within the vSphere environment can allow for a greater ability to adapt and react to end of support deadlines and changes in vSphere architecture. Presenters will include HCA\u0027s assistant vice president of infrastructure and operations, engineering and operational resources, and its dedicated enterprise technical account manager.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 12:00:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 12:58:51","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"58 Minutes 51 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/ce7da67320be49e5bb28abbe3350313b1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/ce7da67320be49e5bb28abbe3350313b1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/ce7da67320be49e5bb28abbe3350313b1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/ce7da67320be49e5bb28abbe3350313b1d/5ea0ae0f-10c3-4d3e-b772-28662190b201_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/ce7da67320be49e5bb28abbe3350313b1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"9bc791361c8343a9a79fd88f51f4deab2a","Name":"Brad Calvert, HCA, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Brad Calvert, HCA, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1068328549,"ParentResource":"ce7da673-20be-49e5-bb28-abbe3350313b"},{"Id":"bf5dcbe08d5d4ba89c9252cc6152557c2a","Name":"Lee Cooper, HCA","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Lee Cooper, HCA","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-2146064388,"ParentResource":"ce7da673-20be-49e5-bb28-abbe3350313b"},{"Id":"81ab510043734c5d92f5db25bf94173f2a","Name":"Jeff Guillote, VMware, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jeff Guillote, VMware, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2079919264,"ParentResource":"ce7da673-20be-49e5-bb28-abbe3350313b"},{"Id":"ba95bfdd4a294c098937480e1cd2f5902a","Name":"Joshua Surre, HCA","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Joshua Surre, HCA","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1948498140,"ParentResource":"ce7da673-20be-49e5-bb28-abbe3350313b"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":38},{"Id":"51745b030dc24ca5944c40487a5ce5571d","Name":"INF8845 - vSphere Logs Grow Up!

Some gas and electric companies even offered rebates for virtualization and server consolidation projects. Now, with many businesses achieving virtualization ratios of 90 percent or more, they might assume they\u0027ve achieved all the savings that can be offered from their hypervisor - but is that truly the case? In this session, we will discuss the hypervisor and the role it played in transforming not only the data center, but also what businesses and organizations have achieved because of it. We\u0027ll then talk about the all-important VM-to-host density ratio and how to make sure you\u0027re packing the most VMs that you can onto each cluster. Not only does the hypervisor provide tangible savings by itself, it\u0027s also the foundation of the Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC), and we\u0027ll discuss how it can be leveraged to virtualize other components in a data center\u0026mdash;thus improving savings and reducing TCO. Last but not least, we\u0027ll take a look at the oftentimes unnoticed but extremely important topic of OpEx and dive into how the SDDC can provide incredible efficiencies and savings as well as how it can accelerate the rate of innovation and development.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"10:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 10:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 11:07:39","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"37 Minutes 39 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/b3e29a4c65d140b195db808acafebf6d1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/b3e29a4c65d140b195db808acafebf6d1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/b3e29a4c65d140b195db808acafebf6d1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b3e29a4c65d140b195db808acafebf6d1d/8fb4da46-5f36-41f8-a7bf-3146e1beae59_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/b3e29a4c65d140b195db808acafebf6d1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"20f6406671574831a5d4d0115ce3dda52a","Name":"Scott Calvet, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Scott Calvet, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1805896303,"ParentResource":"b3e29a4c-65d1-40b1-95db-808acafebf6d"},{"Id":"b5571a219c8f4017928788a06f02f6912a","Name":"David Zolnier, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"David Zolnier, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":416762991,"ParentResource":"b3e29a4c-65d1-40b1-95db-808acafebf6d"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":6},{"Id":"d27e7c78b6ed419196741a4b766de9ca1d","Name":"INF8251 - vSphere Host Fabric: Why It Matters to You?","PresentationRootId":"d27e7c78-b6ed-4191-9674-1a4b766de9ca","Description":"Are you having difficulty navigating industry trends like NVMe versus NVM, DAS versus Fabric, 100G fabric, RDMA versus DPDK, overlay networks versus SDN, offloads\u0026mdash;stateless versus statefull, and composable hardware?

While the out-of-the-box settings should work great for all of you, we recognize that there is no single best configuration for everyone. In this talk, we will help you get the most out of vCenter Server from a performance perspective. We will examine the vCenter Server in detail and provide best practices for performance and scale. We start with a refresher course on vCenter Server internals and describe the various functional pieces that make up vCenter Server, starting with vCenter Server 6.0 and providing some insights on future directions. We move on to discuss issues that may impact performance of either vCenter Server or the Web client\u0026mdash;for example, interactions between vCenter Server and its database, Java service settings inside vCenter Server, and interactions with applications like VMware vRealize Operations Manager or VMware NSX. We then discuss the salient differences between vCenter Server for Windows and the vCenter Server Appliance. We also describe enhancements that allow larger cluster sizes and higher operational throughput. Finally, we look ahead to future architectural directions that will further enhance the performance and usability of vCenter Server for 2016 and beyond.","AirDateDisplay":"Thursday, September 1, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"10:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"09/01/2016 10:30:00","FullEndDate":"09/01/2016 11:23:57","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"53 Minutes 57 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/ab74bd97e0fc4d888ad3ea452eb9d1a01d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/ab74bd97e0fc4d888ad3ea452eb9d1a01d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/ab74bd97e0fc4d888ad3ea452eb9d1a01d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/ab74bd97e0fc4d888ad3ea452eb9d1a01d/2f1fc7ee-618f-46e9-9fd9-180e6390a1de_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/ab74bd97e0fc4d888ad3ea452eb9d1a01d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"6a49fa41a267401da284b537384cbbf52a","Name":"priya sethuraman, vmware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"priya sethuraman, vmware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1790250825,"ParentResource":"ab74bd97-e0fc-4d88-8ad3-ea452eb9d1a0"},{"Id":"df2f7ddf4187456a9a5a6fe1ece93bf62a","Name":"Ravi Soundararajan, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Ravi Soundararajan, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-956313041,"ParentResource":"ab74bd97-e0fc-4d88-8ad3-ea452eb9d1a0"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":215},{"Id":"e29043f579bf4fb48a64da560402f5171d","Name":"INF8379 - Virtualization 101","PresentationRootId":"e29043f5-79bf-4fb4-8a64-da560402f517","Description":"New to virtualization?

This transition to IT as a business has positioned IT operations as a service provider, with its own profit-and-loss center that builds and operates a private cloud. The internal private cloud moved VMware from virtualization to a private cloud and completely changed the way IT operates. The internal private cloud was built as a business with multidimensional goals of availability, agility, cost, and VMware on VMware. The internal private cloud has enabled VMware\u0027s research and development team to releases products in a more agile way.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"4:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 16:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 16:40:56","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"40 Minutes 56 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/97d9856afd7c4fbfa667fc81725f13351d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/97d9856afd7c4fbfa667fc81725f13351d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/97d9856afd7c4fbfa667fc81725f13351d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/97d9856afd7c4fbfa667fc81725f13351d/d9dc6380-ec3b-4fb4-a47c-67a6ad9491a5_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/97d9856afd7c4fbfa667fc81725f13351d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"53d409dcc9cb48e283b90b683b51d7e02a","Name":"Velchamy Sankarlingam, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Velchamy Sankarlingam, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-637915606,"ParentResource":"97d9856a-fd7c-4fbf-a667-fc81725f1335"},{"Id":"b83011d83d4b456595c92061d8e341d92a","Name":"Avon Puri, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Avon Puri, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-2042663936,"ParentResource":"97d9856a-fd7c-4fbf-a667-fc81725f1335"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":4},{"Id":"42cf4dd6366949a29a17f21688478c751d","Name":"INF8045 - vSphere High Availability Best Practices and Tech Preview","PresentationRootId":"42cf4dd6-3669-49a2-9a17-f21688478c75","Description":"In this session, we cover VMware vSphere High Availability (HA) best practices, ensuring you with the practices and settings that provide the highest availability possible for your virtual machines and applications.

The criticality and probability of those risks can determine the likelihood of success or failure.\n\nRisk management is normally under the purview of security or compliance and comes down to the architect as a set of controls, which dictates the overarching parameters for the design.\n\nThis presentation argues that an architect equipped with the knowledge and tools of the risk management practice can virtually guarantee the success (or foresee failure) of any design before it has started.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 13:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 13:32:03","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"32 Minutes 3 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/3af7c18cdcbd4b8992fce28d403749f71d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/3af7c18cdcbd4b8992fce28d403749f71d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/3af7c18cdcbd4b8992fce28d403749f71d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/3af7c18cdcbd4b8992fce28d403749f71d/12f309ad-705c-4ad9-85db-6b37f5ec1386_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/3af7c18cdcbd4b8992fce28d403749f71d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"c566f165b2294b7d8789c2463382d4522a","Name":"Daemon Behr, Scalar Decisions","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Daemon Behr, Scalar Decisions","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":794073601,"ParentResource":"3af7c18c-dcbd-4b89-92fc-e28d403749f7"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":21},{"Id":"a2031e7b605b4d44b29231e9bce46cdc1d","Name":"INF8469 - iSCSI/iSER: HW SAN Performance Over the Converged Data Center","PresentationRootId":"a2031e7b-605b-4d44-b292-31e9bce46cdc","Description":"The iSCSI protocol enables users to deploy SCSI storage over the converged data center fabric. However, since iSCSI uses TCP, it incurs the overheads associated with software protocol processing. The iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) protocol conducts iSCSI data movement over RDMA, which provides high-bandwidth data transfers while bypassing the CPU; nevertheless, the iSCSI control plane and extensive management infrastructure are preserved. With the advent of native RDMA support, VMware ESXi now supports the creation of iSER initiators and their registration with iSCSI transport layer, paving the way for efficient, high-performance shared storage in the virtual cloud. \n\nThis session provides an in-depth technology preview and evaluation of iSER for ESXi. First, we will review the iSCSI datapath and its acceleration using iSER. Second, we will describe the implementation of a VMware ESX iSER initiator, based on the RDMA DDK. Finally, we will review typical iSER SAN configurations and demonstrate the significant performance benefits achieved.","AirDateDisplay":"Wednesday, August 31, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/31/2016 13:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/31/2016 13:40:35","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"40 Minutes 35 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/a2031e7b605b4d44b29231e9bce46cdc1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/a2031e7b605b4d44b29231e9bce46cdc1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/a2031e7b605b4d44b29231e9bce46cdc1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a2031e7b605b4d44b29231e9bce46cdc1d/61b0de98-dc93-4af8-b5fe-ab86e89d541b_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a2031e7b605b4d44b29231e9bce46cdc1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"257235847d2c4f5c8abd9c24ac74cb562a","Name":"Liran Liss, Mellanox Technologies","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Liran Liss, Mellanox Technologies","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":616318197,"ParentResource":"a2031e7b-605b-4d44-b292-31e9bce46cdc"},{"Id":"584132bb1a94408083ac8ff40084ff022a","Name":"Hemanth Kalluri, VMware Inc","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Hemanth Kalluri, VMware Inc","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1383367817,"ParentResource":"a2031e7b-605b-4d44-b292-31e9bce46cdc"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":6},{"Id":"41852cbd00894e359ccde5125bfa1b991d","Name":"INF8250 - Case Study: Using vCloud Suite to monitor Global operations","PresentationRootId":"41852cbd-0089-4e35-9ccd-e5125bfa1b99","Description":"The world is moving towards Gen 2.5 and Gen 3 type workloads.

This technology offers persistence at near memory speeds in large enough capacity to change the storage vs memory paradigm used by databases, analytics, and filesystems. In this session you will hear our technologists\u0027 vision of what changes in the data center when byte-addressable non-volatile memory technology removes the storage I/O bottleneck. Learn how VMware is working to ensure vSphere can deliver the improved performance and capacity of NVM with the virtualization benefits of workload agility and optimized consolidation. Chief Platform Architect Richard Brunner will join the presentation to discuss the expected architecture of non-volatile memory in new server platforms and the growing standards for system and application software to exploit it. VMware Fellow Pratap Subrahmanyam will also provide a preview of NVM\u0027s potential by demonstrating applications running on virtualized byte-addressable non-volatile memory -- a view inside of VMware\u0027s skunk works efforts. We invite data center architects, storage experts, ISVs, and developers of all stripes to share our discoveries and insights in this exciting new technology.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 17:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 18:04:19","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 4 Minutes 19 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/5f5a60b34dc14ae1896b75545ddf01871d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/5f5a60b34dc14ae1896b75545ddf01871d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/5f5a60b34dc14ae1896b75545ddf01871d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5f5a60b34dc14ae1896b75545ddf01871d/830039ee-19b1-498f-bb20-9702c2ca8376_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5f5a60b34dc14ae1896b75545ddf01871d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"510bbd8feac049029aa7aa266bccc22c2a","Name":"Aaron Blasius, VMware Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Aaron Blasius, VMware Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-731391079,"ParentResource":"5f5a60b3-4dc1-4ae1-896b-75545ddf0187"},{"Id":"b9f2a27d8f5a413d936ef06a38b058182a","Name":"Rajesh Venkatasubramanian, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Rajesh Venkatasubramanian, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":324198986,"ParentResource":"5f5a60b3-4dc1-4ae1-896b-75545ddf0187"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":13},{"Id":"41525d45138840579807d0311d0cb1b11d","Name":"INF8856 - vSphere Encryption Deep Dive: Technology Preview","PresentationRootId":"41525d45-1388-4057-9807-d0311d0cb1b1","Description":"Encryption has become more than just a \u0026quot;checkbox\u0026quot; in a security story.

Finally, take a sneak peek into the future directions for vMotion, including encrypted vMotion and migration to public clouds.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 16:39:25","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 9 Minutes 25 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/da8f3f11719b451f91ce23fcbc33c63b1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/da8f3f11719b451f91ce23fcbc33c63b1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/da8f3f11719b451f91ce23fcbc33c63b1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/da8f3f11719b451f91ce23fcbc33c63b1d/91822fbe-9dc0-4ed5-b60f-055d25b2e521_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/da8f3f11719b451f91ce23fcbc33c63b1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"dbd2535035f24fd2a717b68e56158e332a","Name":"Sreekanth Setty, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Sreekanth Setty, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2053290692,"ParentResource":"da8f3f11-719b-451f-91ce-23fcbc33c63b"},{"Id":"f30bf8c41eb84200b3b1d151208693102a","Name":"Arunachalam Ramanathan, VMWare Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Arunachalam Ramanathan, VMWare Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":841554012,"ParentResource":"da8f3f11-719b-451f-91ce-23fcbc33c63b"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":17},{"Id":"288478a3d7de4240ad3e95647a5fa74c1d","Name":"INF8097 - Production Is Down and So Are My Tools: Meeting Infrastructure High Availability by Deploying an Out-of-Band Management Cluster, A Customer Evolution","PresentationRootId":"288478a3-d7de-4240-ad3e-95647a5fa74c","Description":"A large northeastern regional bank is utilizing VMware\u0027s Virtual SAN and NSX to support its production environment and meet its high-availability needs. By moving vCenter Server and other third-party management components from its production environment to a Virtual SAN enabled vSphere management cluster, the bank is able to use these critical tools if there is a production outage. Virtual SAN delivers the shared storage capacity and performance that these demanding workloads require. This use case leverages the latest version of vSphere and Virtual SAN 6.2 to take advantage of all-flash arrays, deduplication, compression, and inherited redundancy (distributed RAID 5, VMware\u0027s vSphere DRS, High Availability, and Fault Tolerance). NSX will provide security through micro-segmentation and flexibility using VXLAN. Additional redundancy within the data center is achieved by segregating the vSphere cluster by fault domains (for example, splitting hosts into different racks on the other side of the data center).","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 16:31:36","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 1 Minute 36 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/288478a3d7de4240ad3e95647a5fa74c1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/288478a3d7de4240ad3e95647a5fa74c1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/288478a3d7de4240ad3e95647a5fa74c1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/288478a3d7de4240ad3e95647a5fa74c1d/d6df24e7-2ef8-4367-ba0a-ea9d16fc3f8f_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/288478a3d7de4240ad3e95647a5fa74c1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"3ffc22efd4574768b8ac8507cc086cb72a","Name":"Tom Cronin, M\u0026T Bank","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Tom Cronin, M\u0026T Bank","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1562130914,"ParentResource":"288478a3-d7de-4240-ad3e-95647a5fa74c"},{"Id":"4a468df9150b42cdb57ad80451bbc3d72a","Name":"Dan Curr, M\u0026T Bank","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Dan Curr, M\u0026T Bank","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-997843617,"ParentResource":"288478a3-d7de-4240-ad3e-95647a5fa74c"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":8},{"Id":"5c1e3cf9c4154397a3bfa2664a34bba01d","Name":"INF8837 - How to Relocate Your Physical Data Center Without Downtime in a Few Clicks, Thanks to Automation","PresentationRootId":"5c1e3cf9-c415-4397-a3bf-a2664a34bba0","Description":"Have you ever dreamed of moving your workloads from one physical data center to another without any service disruption? This is, in fact, possible! Moving physical servers to a different location always involves painful logistics and implies downtime and hardware surprises after transportation. Physical relocation is a challenging and complex task that requires a lot of preparation. Moving entire data centers without shutting down any workloads requires proper preparation and execution. Virtualization comes to help in this challenge, as the workload is not directly tied to the underlying physical hardware. VMware vCenter offers native toolkits to execute such complex tasks. However, adding more control and efficiency to the migration process requires additional efforts. During the execution, project managers struggle to provide real-time visibility to management and to the business. The data provided is usually delayed and inaccurate, especially in cases of continuous machine relocations, as the spreadsheets are often manually updated. Using vCenter and VMware vRealize Orchestrator in conjunction with VMware vRealize Operations Manager can provide real-time migration state monitoring and reporting to management and businesses in a transparent manner. vRealize Operations Manager also helps in performance analysis, which is necessary for automated decisions during workflows in order to move the workloads according to their activities. In this presentation, we will demonstrate a solution to run a fully automated migration of an active data center from planning to final execution.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:00 PM CDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 17:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 17:57:08","TimeZoneId":"19","DurationDisplay":"57 Minutes 8 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/5c1e3cf9c4154397a3bfa2664a34bba01d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/5c1e3cf9c4154397a3bfa2664a34bba01d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/5c1e3cf9c4154397a3bfa2664a34bba01d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5c1e3cf9c4154397a3bfa2664a34bba01d/53ce36bd-3d49-4a7d-a88a-dc979d28d0bd_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5c1e3cf9c4154397a3bfa2664a34bba01d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[{"Name":"Video (Composite Video)","Url":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/5c1e3cf9c4154397a3bfa2664a34bba01d/1d0ea2ca-af1f-4493-bc62-7dff22524389.mp4?attachmentName=INF8837+-+How+to+Relocate+Your+Physical+Data+Cente.mp4\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE"}],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":316,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"547e855815f44e6c86eb9af40cddc46d2a","Name":"René-François MENNECIER, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"René-François MENNECIER, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":161787845,"ParentResource":"5c1e3cf9-c415-4397-a3bf-a2664a34bba0"},{"Id":"b228754164de423f92d8aad0616fc6472a","Name":"Konstantin Nachev, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Konstantin Nachev, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1395591112,"ParentResource":"5c1e3cf9-c415-4397-a3bf-a2664a34bba0"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":true,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":124},{"Id":"694e90ab80224d7e8d1f46c0e636ec8f1d","Name":"INF8122 - A Storage Story: Capacity Management and Performance Planning for Storage Systems in vRealize Operations","PresentationRootId":"694e90ab-8022-4d7e-8d1f-46c0e636ec8f","Description":"Do you want to know if your LUN is the reason your virtual machines are underperforming?

In a highly distributed system, monitoring just health of service at endpoint isn\u0027t sufficient.

Every cloud provider has their own agents to monitor their infrastructure and endpoint applications. Given the present situation in the market, there is no single pane of control/solution that\u0027s both simple and powerful. In this session, we will demonstrate how to use VMware vRealize Suite in order to monitor endpoints in multicloud (Amazon Web Services, Azure, etc.) and identify patterns with ease.

In particular, they are concerned about what knobs to set at various levels for their workload\u0026mdash;either at the host BIOS level, host OS level, or even the virtual machine level. In certain cases, it may not be clear what knobs to actually enable or disable\u0026mdash;for example, OS control mode, high-performance mode, P-states, C-states/package C-states, or Turbo Boost. Just simply disabling all sorts of power management knobs may actually hurt the performance of your workload. It is important to understand the impact of various power management technologies in the latest processors to get the best performance/energy efficiency out of your system. This talk will cover all of the above in detail in addition to the latest power management technologies and their impact on performance. We will show how power management can be controlled from within VMware vSphere\u0027s console and how it can benefit your workload in terms of performance and/or performance per watt. We will also talk about what tools to use in order to determine whether your workload is under the influence of power management.

VMware vSphere Auto Deploy collapses the deployment, patching, and upgrading workflows into one unified procedure. By booting hosts from a designated image directly from the network, vSphere administrators centrally control fleets of compute resources at scale. Host profiles enable configuration management at a cluster level, abstracting away the need to fine-tune hosts one by one. The combination of these two vSphere capabilities results in an operationalized infrastructure that can be managed and kept compliant through policies while reducing overall administrative effort. Learn the benefits of stateless infrastructure, see the capabilities in action, and watch demos of exciting new enhancements on the roadmap.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 16:33:27","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"1 Hour 3 Minutes 27 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/8a8828aa47e2459cba51bd3c8dbf1c5c1d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/8a8828aa47e2459cba51bd3c8dbf1c5c1d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/8a8828aa47e2459cba51bd3c8dbf1c5c1d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8a8828aa47e2459cba51bd3c8dbf1c5c1d/db88d7c3-3981-41ff-9a9d-46ce72dd5642_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8a8828aa47e2459cba51bd3c8dbf1c5c1d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"c9fc17efc1ce4e189dd667a79047ffe32a","Name":"Salil Suri, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Salil Suri, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":60639186,"ParentResource":"8a8828aa-47e2-459c-ba51-bd3c8dbf1c5c"},{"Id":"f0a89c86ede946dd85d603ebae3a567f2a","Name":"Eric Gray, VMware, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Eric Gray, VMware, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-126053578,"ParentResource":"8a8828aa-47e2-459c-ba51-bd3c8dbf1c5c"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Introductory"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":11},{"Id":"24813e8638844927ad46b058ebde14291d","Name":"INF9455-SPO - Best Practices for All-Flash Data Reduction Arrays with VMware vSphere","PresentationRootId":"24813e86-3884-4927-ad46-b058ebde1429","Description":"As All-Flash Data Reduction arrays are becoming common place in VMware environments due to their performance, flexibility and ease-of-use, it is important to understand how to best implement and manage them with ESXi.

This is in thanks to the integration of products - including direct contact with customers (vCloud Director), management infrastructure (vCenter), and analysis and prediction tools (vRealize Operations and vRealize Log Insight). As a cloud service provider, we must make difficult sizing choices in advance to avoid clipping the wings of those customers who have frequent and rapid expansion needs. vRealize Operations enables us to check the duration of our investment. We can review the medium- to long-term future by comparing revenues from this extension, without having to exaggerate or underrate them. Using this tool to analyze the root cause gives us the opportunity to optimize structure and stop repeating mistakes that lead to anything from individual customer outages to global outages. Last, but certainly not least, is optimization. Thanks to vRealize Operations, we are able to better communicate with our customers. This provides us with needed data so we can confidently notify customers who are wasting resources as well as those who are underpowered. Clouditalia owes much of its success to the ability to attend to every customer, regardless of the size of his or her business. Much of the credit is due to vSphere with Operations Management.

In a highly distributed system, monitoring just health of service at endpoint isn\u0027t sufficient. For instance, the health of an application or service might be good, but the resource used by the application might be unavailable. Every cloud provider has their own agents to monitor their infrastructure and endpoint applications. Given the present situation in the market, there is no single pane of control/solution that\u0027s both simple and powerful. In this session, we will demonstrate how to use VMware vRealize Suite in order to monitor endpoints in multicloud (Amazon Web Services, Azure, etc.) and identify patterns with ease. We will also address how to develop customized solutions using vRealize Suite components.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"12:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 12:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 13:27:33","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"57 Minutes 33 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/c57a80b540ff477d9ab00e904b8fd9961d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/c57a80b540ff477d9ab00e904b8fd9961d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/c57a80b540ff477d9ab00e904b8fd9961d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c57a80b540ff477d9ab00e904b8fd9961d/8f780b98-4d93-443c-b510-7df6ec236913_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/c57a80b540ff477d9ab00e904b8fd9961d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"dab3d559cebe435f94039a682f9cb3502a","Name":"Arunvijai Sridharan, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Arunvijai Sridharan, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":716315459,"ParentResource":"c57a80b5-40ff-477d-9ab0-0e904b8fd996"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Cloud Management","Software-Defined Data Center"," Technical – Intermediate"," Breakout Session"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":3},{"Id":"5f18c57de2ca4e08a1d0c9431481d0dd1d","Name":"INF8663 - The Making of a Legend-Dairy Software-Defined Data Center","PresentationRootId":"5f18c57d-e2ca-4e08-a1d0-c9431481d0dd","Description":"We\u0027ve realized the benefits of a software-defined data center ... and you can too!

Session content is based in part on questions heard most often from vSphere administrators via the VMware training team.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:00 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 11:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 11:48:17","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"48 Minutes 17 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/a9296c86f2fb47dd8c832660bcda15841d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/a9296c86f2fb47dd8c832660bcda15841d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a9296c86f2fb47dd8c832660bcda15841d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a9296c86f2fb47dd8c832660bcda15841d/966855a9-3894-4b17-a38a-24694f5a2119_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/a9296c86f2fb47dd8c832660bcda15841d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"f851e3e1fcf9405cb24c43a9080ae2ae2a","Name":"Carl Paterik, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Carl Paterik, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1990188255,"ParentResource":"a9296c86-f2fb-47dd-8c83-2660bcda1584"},{"Id":"55405226051042cb95df122f6064961c2a","Name":"Jon Loux, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Jon Loux, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":1329689029,"ParentResource":"a9296c86-f2fb-47dd-8c83-2660bcda1584"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":["Software-Defined Data Center"," Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced"," Cloud Infrastructure"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":8},{"Id":"bca9e709e020419289ee8600c33807c81d","Name":"MGT8439 - Lessons Learned from EMC IT\u0027s Data Center Evolution","PresentationRootId":"bca9e709-e020-4192-89ee-8600c33807c8","Description":"Virtualization is an enabler to agility, but automation is the key to unlocking its full potential.

With a slowing global economy, businesses and organizations of all sizes are tightening IT budgets, forcing the question of whether or not they should migrate completely to a platform that is open source or included with an OS that they already own or one that is able to run multiple hypervisors. For example, mission-critical apps deserve the most stable and mature platform, while less important environments like labs or branch offices can get away with the \u0026quot;free\u0026quot; solution. Because the hypervisor is truly the foundation and first step toward building any Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC)/hybrid cloud\u0026mdash;or even the public cloud for that matter\u0026mdash;the importance of this decision cannot be understated. In this session, we will have an honest talk about the current discussions surrounding hypervisor commoditization and motivators towards running multiple solutions, or all-out migration. We will discuss what other offerings are out there and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We\u0027ll also dive into why the hypervisor is so fundamentally important to the success of any SDDC/hybrid cloud and how VMware vSphere is the best solution both technically and financially. Last, we\u0027ll uncover the true costs and complexities of running multiple hypervisors and why it usually doesn\u0027t make sense to do so.","AirDateDisplay":"Sunday, August 28, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"1:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/28/2016 13:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/28/2016 13:32:20","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"32 Minutes 20 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/98153adca06746d29c045e02b8a3f0311d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/98153adca06746d29c045e02b8a3f0311d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/98153adca06746d29c045e02b8a3f0311d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/98153adca06746d29c045e02b8a3f0311d/c5d7cf35-a630-4ab7-ba15-778e01e73aa3_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/98153adca06746d29c045e02b8a3f0311d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","Presenters":[{"Id":"4411fc0c41c3488e97bb1417e8ae62302a","Name":"Scott Calvet, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Scott Calvet, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1805896303,"ParentResource":"98153adc-a067-46d2-9c04-5e02b8a3f031"},{"Id":"28c724d3412b493ebe063d771a06c7882a","Name":"David Zolnier, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"David Zolnier, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":416762991,"ParentResource":"98153adc-a067-46d2-9c04-5e02b8a3f031"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions","Software-Defined Data Center"," Cloud Infrastructure"," Quick Talk"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":11}],"CurrentFolder":{"Id":"c9ac9244-2cc5-4ab5-87da-e2e4577c75ab","ParentCatalogFolderId":"ccf3adb0-c156-4815-bb02-90195c0edccc","CatalogId":"dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40","DynamicFolderId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","DynamicFolderName":null,"RootDynamicFolderId":"dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40","Name":"Cloud Infrastructure","Description":"","Type":3,"DisplayOptions":13,"Shortcut":null,"IsReadOnly":true,"Owner":"bruceh","IsStaticFolder":false,"IsDynamicFolder":false,"IsVirtualFolder":true,"IncludeSubFolders":true,"IsSearchBased":false,"LimitSearchToCatalog":true,"MyMediasiteChannel":false,"CanPublishTo":false,"IsSearchBasedCatalog":false,"IsMyMediasiteChannel":false,"IsPublishingCatalog":false,"DatabaseId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8","SecurityId":"c1090e09-1df4-4ed7-bca6-19d9112dabb8"},"RssUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/rss/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/c1090e091df44ed7bca619d9112dabb814/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","FriendlyUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/c1090e091df44ed7bca619d9112dabb814/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","EditUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/edit/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021","EmbedCode":"\u003ciframe width=\"1020\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/c1090e091df44ed7bca619d9112dabb814/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Catalog/Full/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021/c1090e091df44ed7bca619d9112dabb814/dbf1ec2825574dd3a381e5fe4ceabc4021\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-align:left\" \u003eView Full Screen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/small\u003e","Success":false,"Message":null,"LoginUrl":null,"ErrorDetails":null,"ValidationErrors":null}
